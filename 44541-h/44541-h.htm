<h2>NOTE</h2>


<p>The address I delivered on August 26 at the
Fourth International Congress of Zoology at
Cambridge, 'On our Present Knowledge of
the Descent of Man,' has, I find, from the
high significance of the theme and the
general importance of the questions connected
with it, excited much interest, and
has led to requests for its publication.
Hence this volume, edited by my friend
Dr. H. Gadow, my pupil in earlier days,
who has not only revised the text, but has
also enriched it by many valuable additions
and notes.</p>

<h2>THE LAST LINK</h2>


<p>At the end of the nineteenth century, the
age of 'natural science,' the department of
knowledge that has made most progress is
zoology. From zoology has arisen the study
of transformism, which now dominates the
whole of biology. Lamarck<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> laid its foundation
in 1809, and forty years ago Charles
Darwin obtained for it a recognition which
is now universal. It is not my task to repeat
the well-known principles of Darwinism. I
am not concerned to explain the scientific
value of the whole theory of descent. The
whole of our biological study is pervaded by
it. No general problem in zoology and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
botany, in anatomy and physiology, can be
discussed without the question arising, How
has this problem originated? What are the
real causes of its development?</p>

<p>This question was almost unknown seventy
years ago, when Charles Darwin, the great
reformer of biology, began his academical
career at Cambridge as a student of theology.
In the same year, 1828, Carl Ernst von
Baer<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> published in Germany his classical
work on the embryology of animals, the first
successful attempt to elucidate by 'observation
and reflection' the mysterious origin
of the animal body from the egg, and to
explain in every respect the 'history of the
growing individuality.' Darwin at that time
had no knowledge of this great advance, and
he could not divine that forty years later
embryology would be one of the strongest
supports of his own life's work&mdash;of that very
theory of transformism which, founded by
Lamarck in the year of Darwin's birth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
was accepted with enthusiasm by Charles's
grandfather Erasmus. There is no doubt
that of all the celebrated naturalists of the
nineteenth century Darwin achieved the
greatest success, and we should be justified
in designating the last forty years as the
Age of Darwin.</p>

<p>In searching for the causes of this unexampled
success, we must clearly separate
three sets of considerations: first, the comprehensive
reform of Lamarck's transformism,
and its firm establishment by the many
arguments drawn from modern biology;
secondly, the construction of the new theory
of selection, as established by Darwin, and
independently by Alfred Wallace (a theory
called Darwinism in the proper sense);
thirdly, the deduction of anthropogeny, that
most important conclusion of the theory of
descent, the value of which far surpasses all
the other truths in evolution.</p>

<p>It is the third point of Darwin's theory
that I shall discuss here; and I shall discuss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
it chiefly with the intention of examining
critically the evidence and the different
conclusions which at present represent our
scientific knowledge of the descent of man
and of the different stages of his animal
pedigree.</p>

<p>It is now generally admitted that this
problem is the most important of all biological
questions. Huxley was right when
in 1863 he called it the question of questions
for mankind. The problem which underlies
all others, and is more deeply interesting than
any other, is as to the place which man
occupies in nature and his relations to the
universe of things. 'Whence our race has
come; what are the limits of our power over
nature, and of nature's power over us; to
what goal are we tending&mdash;these are the
problems which present themselves anew
and with undiminished interest to every man
born into the world.' This impressive view
was explained by Huxley thirty-five years ago
in his three celebrated essays on 'Evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
as to Man's Place in Nature.' The first is
entitled 'On the Natural History of the Man-like
Apes'; the second, 'On the Relations of
Man to the Lower Animals'; the third, 'On
some Fossil Remains of Man.' Darwin himself
felt the burden of these problems as much
as Huxley; but in his chief work, 'On the
Origin of Species,' in 1859, he had purposely
only just touched them, suggesting that the
theory of descent would shed light upon the
origin of man and his history. Twelve years
later, in his celebrated work on 'The Descent
of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex,'
Darwin discussed fully and ingeniously all
the different sides of this 'question of
questions' from the morphological, historical,
physiological, and psychological points of
view. As early as 1866 I myself had applied
in the <i>Generelle Morphologie der Organismen</i>
the theory of transformism to anthropology,
and had shown that the fundamental law of
biogeny claims the same value for man as for
all the other animals. The intimate causal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
connection between ontogeny and phylogeny,
between the development of the individual and
the history of its ancestors, enables us to gain
a safe and certain knowledge of our ancestral
series. I had at that time distinguished in
this series ten chief degrees of vertebrate
organization. I attributed the highest importance
to the logical connection of anthropogeny
with transformism. If the latter be
true, the truth of the former is absolute.
'Our theory that man is descended from
lower vertebrates, and immediately from apes
or primates, is a case of special <i>deduction</i>
which follows with absolute certainty from the
general <i>induction</i> of the theory of descent.'
The full proof and detailed explanation of
this view was afterwards given in my
'History of Natural Creation,' and especially
in my 'Anthropogeny.'<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Lastly, it has
received an ample scientific and critical
foundation in the third part of my 'Systematic
Phylogeny.'<sup>[3]</sup></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>
<p>During the forty years which have elapsed
since Darwin's first publication of his theories
an enormous literature, discussing the <i>general
problems</i> of transformism as well as its special
application to man, has been published. In
spite of the wide divergence of the different
views, all agree in one main point: the
natural development of man cannot be separated
from general transformism. There are
only two possibilities. Either all the various
species of animals and plants have been
created independently by supernatural forces
(and in this case the creation of man also is a
miracle); or the species have been produced
in a natural way by transmutation, by adaptation
and progressive heredity (and in this
case man also is descended from other vertebrates,
and immediately from a series of
primates). We are absolutely convinced that
only the latter theory is fully scientific. To
prove its truth, we have to examine critically
the strength of the different arguments claimed
for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap"/>

<h2>I.</h2>


<p>First, we have to consider the relative
place which comparative anatomy concedes
to man in the 'natural system' of animals,
for the true value of our 'natural classification'
is based upon its meaning as a pedigree.
All the minor and major groups of the system&mdash;the
classes, legions, orders, families, genera,
and species&mdash;are only different branches of
the same pedigree. For man himself, his
place in the pedigree has been fixed since
Lamarck,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> in 1801, defined the group of
vertebrates. The most perfect<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> of these are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the Mammalia; and at the head of this class
stands the order of Primates, in which Linnæus,
in 1735, united four 'genera'&mdash;Homo,
Simia, Lemur, and Vespertilio. If we exclude
the last-named, the Chiroptera of modern
zoology, there remain three natural groups of
Primates&mdash;the Lemures, the Simiæ, and the
Anthropi or Hominidæ. This is the classification<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
of the majority of zoologists; but if we
compare man with the two chief groups of
monkeys&mdash;the Eastern monkeys (or Catarrhinæ)
and the Western or American monkeys
(Platyrrhinæ)&mdash;there can be no doubt that the
former group is much more closely related to
man than is the latter. In the natural order
of the Catarrhinæ we find united a long series
of lower and higher forms. The lowest, the
Cynopitheci, appear still closely related to
the Platyrrhinæ and to the Lemures; while,
on the other hand, the tailless apes (Anthropomorphæ)
approach man through their
higher organization. Hence one of our best
authorities on the Primates, Robert Hartmann,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
proposed to subdivide the whole
order of the Simiæ into three groups:</p>

<p>(1) Primarii, man together with the other
Anthropomorphæ, or tailless apes; (2)
Simiæ, all the other monkeys; (3) Prosimiæ,
or Lemurs. This arrangement has received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
strong support from the interesting discovery
by Selenka that the peculiar placentation of
the human embryo is the same as in the
great apes, and different from that of all the
other monkeys. Our choice between these
different classifications of Primates is best
determined by the important thesis of Huxley,
in which, in 1863, he carried out a most careful
and critical comparison of all the anatomical
gradations within this order. In my opinion,
this ingenious thesis&mdash;which I have called the
Huxleyan Law, or the 'Pithecometra-thesis
of Huxley'&mdash;is of the utmost value. It runs
as follows: 'Thus, whatever system of
organs be studied, the comparison of their
modifications in the ape-series leads to one
and the same result&mdash;that the structural
differences which separate man from the
gorilla and the chimpanzee are not so great
as those which separate the gorilla from the
lower apes.' If we accept the Huxleyan
law without prejudice, and apply it to the
natural classification of the Primates, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
must concede that man's place is within the
order of the Simiæ. On examining this
relation with care, and judging with logical
persistence, we may even go a step further.
Instead of the wider conception of 'Simiæ,'
we must use the restricted term of Catarrhinæ,
and our Pithecometra-thesis has then
to be formulated as follows: <i>The comparative
anatomy of all organs of the group of Catarrhine
Simiæ leads to the result that the
morphological differences between man and
the great apes are not so great as are those
between the man-like apes and the lowest
Catarrhinæ</i>. In fact, it is very difficult to
show why man should not be classed with
the large apes in the same zoological family.
We all know a man from an ape; but it is
quite another thing to find differences which
are absolute and not of degree only. Speaking
generally, we may say that man alone
combines the four following features: (1)
Erect walk; (2) extremities differentiated
accordingly; (3) articulate speech; (4) higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
reasoning power. Speech and reason are
obviously relative distinctions only&mdash;the direct
result of more brains and more brain-power,
the so-called mental faculties. The erect walk
is not an absolutely distinguishing characteristic:
the large apes likewise walk on their
feet only, supporting their bodies by touching
the ground with the backs of their hands&mdash;in
fact, with their knuckles&mdash;and this is a mode
of progression very different from that of the
tailed monkeys, which walk upon the palms
of their hands. There are, however, two
obvious differences in the development of
the muscles. In man alone the gastrocnemius
and the soleus muscle are thick
enough to form the calf of the leg, and
the glutæus maximus is enlarged into the
buttocks. A fourth glutæal muscle occurs
occasionally in man, while it is constantly
present in apes as the so-called musculus
scansorius. Concerning the muscles of the
whole body, we cannot do better than quote
Testut's summary: 'The mass of recorded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
observations upon the muscular anomalies in
man is so great, and the agreement of many
of these with the condition normal in apes is so
marked, that the gap which usually separates
the muscular system of man from that of the
apes appears to be completely bridged over.'</p>

<p>There are, for example, the muscles of the
ear. In most people the majority, or even
all of them, are no longer movable at will,
while in the apes they are still in use. The
important point, however, is that these
muscles are still present in man, although
often in a reduced condition. They are the
following: (1) Musculus auricularis anterior
or attrahens auris, which is frequently much
reduced and no longer reaches the ear at all,
being then absolutely useless; (2) Musculus
auricularis superior or attollens auris, more
constant than the former; (3) Musculus
auricularis posterior or retrahens auris, likewise
often functional. Occasionally smaller
slips differentiated from these three muscles
are present, and as so-called intrinsic muscles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a><br /><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
are restricted to the ear itself; their function
is, or was, that of curling up or opening the
external ear.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="./images/i_0231.jpg">
    <img src="./images/i_0231.jpg" alt="Outlines of the Left Ear"></img></a>

<p><small>1. <i>Lemur macaco</i>; 2. <i>Macacus rhesus</i>, the Rhesus monkey;
3. Cercopithecus, a macaque; 4. human embryo of six months;
5. man, with Darwin's point well retained: the dotted outline is that

original tip of the ear; 7. human ear with the principal muscles.</small></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In connection with the ear, I may touch
upon another interesting and most suggestive
little feature which is present in many
individuals&mdash;namely, 'Darwin's point.' This
is the last remnant of the original tip of the
ear, before the outer, upper, and hinder rim
became doubled up or folded in. It is a
feature quite useless, and absolutely impossible
of interpretation, excepting as the vestige of
such previous ancestral conditions as are
normal in the monkeys.</p>

<p>In some cases the reduction of muscles
has proceeded further in apes than in man&mdash;for
example, the muscles of the little toe.
Another instance is afforded by the coccyx or
vestige of the tail; this is still furnished with
muscles which are now in man, as well as in
the apes, quite useless, and vary considerably
with every sign of degeneration, most so in
the orang-utan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>Darwin has mentioned the frequent action
of the 'snarling muscle,' by which, in sneering,
our upper canine teeth are exposed, like those
of a dog prepared to fight.</p>

<p>Monkeys and apes possess vocal sacs,
especially large in the orang-utan; survivals
of them, although no longer used, persist in
man in the shape of a pair of small diverticula,
the pouches of Morgagni, between the
true and the false vocal cords.</p>

<p>'In the native Australians, the dental formula
appears least removed from the hypothetical
original type, for in it are still found
complete rows of splendid teeth, with powerfully-developed
canines and molars, the latter
being either uniform, or even increasing in
size, as we proceed backwards, in such a
way that the wisdom tooth is the largest of
the series. This is decidedly a pithecoid
characteristic which is always found in apes.
The upper incisors of the Malay, apart from
their prognathous disposition, have occasionally
a distinctly pithecoid form, their anterior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
surface being convex, and their lingual surface
slightly concave. The ancestors of
Europeans seem to have had the same form
of teeth, for the oldest existing fragments of
skulls from the Mammoth age (<i>e.g.</i>, the jaws
from La Naulette, in Belgium) reveal tooth-forms
which must be classed with those of
the lowest races of to-day.'<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Now we are able to apply this fundamental
Pithecometra-thesis directly to the classification
of the Primates and to the phylogeny of
man, which is intimately connected with it,
because in this order, as in all the other
groups of animals, the natural system is the
clear expression of true phylogenetic affinity.
Four results follow from our thesis: (1) The
Primates, as the highest legion or order of
mammals, form one natural, monophyletic
group. All the Lemures, Simiæ, and
Homines descend from one common ancestral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
form, from a hypothetical 'Archiprimas.'
(2) The Lemures are the older and
lower of the natural groups of the Primates;
they stand between the oldest Placentalia
(Prochoriata) and the true Simiæ. (3) All
the Catarrhinæ, or Eastern Simiæ, form one
natural monophyletic group. Their hypothetical
common ancestor, the Archipithecus,
may have descended directly or indirectly
from a branch of the Lemures. (4) Man
is descended directly from one series of
extinct Catarrhine ancestors. The more
recent ancestors of this series were tailless
anthropoids (similar to the Anthropopithecus),
with five sacral vertebræ. The
more remote ancestors were tailed Cercopitheci,
with three or four sacral vertebræ.</p>

<p>These four theses possess, in my opinion,
absolute certainty. They are independent of
all future anatomical, embryological, and
palæontological discoveries which may possibly
throw more light upon the details of
our phyletic anthropogenesis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap"/>
<div class="chapter-beginning"/>
<h2>II.</h2>


<p>The next question is, how the facts of
palæontology agree with these most important
results of comparative anatomy and ontogeny.
The fossils are the true historical 'medals of
creation,' the palpable evidence of the historical
succession of all those innumerable
organic forms which have peopled the globe
for many millions of years. Here the question
arises, If the known fossil specimens of Mammalia,
and particularly of Primates, give proof
of these Pithecometra-theses, do they confirm
directly the descent of man from ape-like
creatures? The answer to this question
is, in my opinion, affirmative.</p>

<p>It is true that the gaps in the palæontological
evidence, here as elsewhere, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
many and keenly felt. In the order of the
Primates they are greater than in many
other orders, chiefly because of the arboreal
life of our ancestors. The explanation is very
simple. It is really due to a long chain of
favourable coincidences if the skeleton of a
vertebrate, covered as it was with flesh and
skin, and containing still more perishable
viscera, is petrified at all. The body may be
devoured by other creatures, and its bones
scattered about; or it rots away and crumbles
to pieces. Many animals hide in thick undergrowth
when death approaches them; and,
leading an almost entirely arboreal life, the
Primates are especially likely to disappear
without being fossilized. It is only when the
body is quickly covered with sand, or is embedded
in suitable lime or silica containing
mud, that the process of petrifaction can
come to pass. Even then it is only by great
good luck that we come across such a fossil.
Very few countries have been searched
systematically, and the areas that have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
searched amount to little in comparison with
the whole surface of the land, even if we
leave out of account the fact that more than
two-thirds of the globe are covered by water.</p>

<p>These deplorable deficiencies of empirical
palæontology are balanced on the other side
by a growing number of positive facts, which
possess an inestimable value in human
phylogeny. The most interesting and most
important of these is the celebrated fossil
<i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i>, discovered in Java
in 1894 by Dr. Eugène Dubois.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Three
years ago this now famous ape-like man
provoked an animated discussion at the third
International Zoological Congress at Leyden.
I may therefore be allowed to say a few
words as to its scientific significance. Unfortunately,
the fossil remains of this creature
are very scanty: the skull-cap, a femur, and
two teeth. It is obviously impossible to form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
from these scanty remains a complete and
satisfactory reconstruction of this remarkable
Pliocene Primate.</p>

<p>The more important points are the following:
The remains in question rested upon a
conglomerate which lies upon a bed of marine
marl and sand of Pliocene age. Together
with the bones of Pithecanthropus were found
those of Stegodon, Leptobos, Rhinoceros, Sus,
Felis, Hyæna, Hippopotamus, Tapir, Elephas,
and a gigantic Pangolin. It is remarkable
that the first two of these genera are now
extinct, and that neither hippopotamus nor
hyæna exists any longer in the Oriental region.
If we may judge from these fossil remains,
the bones of Pithecanthropus are not younger
than the oldest Pleistocene, and probably
belong to the upper Pliocene. The teeth
are like those of man. The femur, also, is
very human, but shows some resemblances
to that of the gibbons. Its size, however,
indicates an animal which stood when erect
not less than 5 feet 6 inches high. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
skull-cap also is very human, but with very
prominent eyebrow ridges, like those of
the famous Neanderthal cranium. It is
certainly not that of an idiot. It had an
estimated cranial capacity of about 1,000
cubic centimetres&mdash;that is to say, much
more than that of the largest ape, which
possesses not more than 600 c.c. The crania
of female Australians and Veddahs measure
not more than 1,100, some even less than
1,000 c.c.; but, as these Veddah women stand
only about 4 feet 9 inches high, the computed
cranial capacity of the much taller Pithecanthropus
is comparatively very low indeed.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>The final result of the long discussion at
Leyden was that, of twelve experts present,
three held that the fossil remains belonged
to a low race of man; three declared them
to be those of a man-like ape of great size;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a><br /><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the rest maintained that they belonged to an
intermediate form, which directly connected
primitive man with the anthropoid apes.
This last view is the right one, and accords
with the laws of logical inference. <i>Pithecanthropus
erectus</i> of Dubois is truly a
Pliocene remainder of that famous group of
highest Catarrhines which were the immediate
pithecoid ancestors of man. He is, indeed, the
long-searched-for 'missing link,' for which, in
1866, I myself had proposed the hypothetical
genus Pithecanthropus, species Alalus.</p>

<p>It must, however, be admitted that this
opinion is still strongly combated by some
distinguished authorities. At the Leyden
Congress it was attacked by the illustrious
pathologist Rudolf Virchow.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> He, however,
is one of the minority of leading men of
science who set themselves to refute the
theory of Evolution in every possible way.
For thirty years he has defended the thesis:
'It is quite certain that man is not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
descendant of apes.' He declares any intermediate
form to be unimaginable save in a
dream.</p>

<p>Virchow went to the Leyden Congress
with the set purpose of disproving that the
bones found by Dubois belonged to a creature
which linked together apes and man. First,
he maintained that the skull was that of an
ape, while the thigh belonged to man. This
insinuation was at once refuted by the expert
palæontologists, who declared that without
the slightest doubt the bones belonged to
one and the same individual. Next, Virchow
explained that certain exostoses or growths
observable on the thigh proved its human
nature, since only under careful treatment
the patient could have healed the original
injury. Thereupon Professor Marsh, the
celebrated palæontologist, exhibited a number
of thigh-bones of wild monkeys which
showed similar exostoses and had healed
without hospital treatment. As a last argument
the Berlin pathologist declared that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
the deep constriction behind the upper
margin of the orbits proved that the skull
was that of an ape, as such never occurred in
man. It so happened that a few weeks later
Professor Nehring of Berlin demonstrated
exactly the same formation on a human prehistoric
skull received by him from Santos,
in Brazil.</p>

<p>Virchow was, in fact, just as unlucky in
Leyden in his fight with our pliocene
ancestor as he had been unfortunate in his
opinion on the famous skulls of Neanderthal,
Spy, La Naulette, etc., every one of which he
explained as a pathological abnormality. It
would be a very curious coincidence indeed if
all these and other fossil human remains
were those of idiots or otherwise abnormal
individuals, provided they are old and low
enough in their organization to be of phylogenetic
value to the unbiassed zoologist.</p>

<p>As the sworn adversary of Evolution,
transformism, and Darwinism in particular,
but a believer in the constancy of species, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
great and renowned pathologist has been
driven to the incredible contention that all
variations of organic forms are pathological.</p>

<p>Four years ago, as honorary president of
the Anthropological Congress at Vienna, he
attacked Darwinism in the severest manner,
and declared that 'man may be as well
descended from the elephant or from the
sheep as from the ape.' Such attacks on the
theory of transformism indicate a failure to
understand the principles of the theory of
Evolution and to appreciate the significance
of palæontology, comparative anatomy, and
ontogeny.</p>

<p>The thousands of other objections which
have been made during the last forty years
(chiefly by outsiders) may be passed over in
silence. They do not require serious refutation.
In spite of, or perhaps because of,
these attacks, the theory of Evolution stands
established more firmly than ever.</p>

<p>It is easy for the outsider to exult over the
difficulties which our problem implies&mdash;diffi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>culties
which we who have given our lives to
the study understand likewise, and try our
best not only to bridge over, but also to
point out. Anyhow, we do not conceal
them; while those who reject the explanation
offered by Evolution make the most of the
gaps, and pass silently over the far more
numerous points favourable to our theory.</p>

<p>How fruitful during the last thirty years
the astonishing progress in our palæontological
knowledge has been for our Pithecometra-thesis
is best shown by a short glance
at the growth of our knowledge of fossil
Primates. Cuvier,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> the founder of palæontology,
continued up to the time of his death,
in 1832, to assert that fossil remains of
monkeys and lemurs did not exist. The
only skull of a fossil lemuroid which he described
(namely, Adapis) he declared to be
that of an ungulate. Not until 1836 were
the first fragments of extinct monkeys found
in India; it was two years later, near Athens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
that the skeleton of <i>Mesopithecus penthelicus</i>
was discovered. Other remains of lemurs
were found in 1862. But during the last
twenty years the number of fossil Primates
has been augmented by the remarkable discoveries
of Gaudry, Filhol, Milne Edwards,
Seeley, Schlosser, and others in Europe; of
Marsh, Cope, Osborn, Leidy, Ameghino, in
South America; and Forsyth Major in
Madagascar.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> These tertiary remains, chiefly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
of Eocene and Miocene date, fill many gaps
between existing genera of Primates, and
afford us quite a clear insight into the phyletic
development of this order during the
millions of years of the Cænozoic age.</p>

<p>The most important difference between the
two groups of existing monkeys is indicated
by their dentition. Adult man possesses,
like all the other Catarrhine Simiæ, thirty-two
teeth, whilst the American monkeys (the
Platyrrhinæ) have thirty-six teeth&mdash;namely,
one pair of premolars more in the upper and
lower jaws. Comparative odontology leads
us to the phylogenetic conclusion that this
number has been produced by reduction from
a still older form with forty-four teeth. This
typical dental formula (three incisors, one
canine, four premolars, and three molars, in
each half-jaw) is common to all those most
important older mammals which in the beginning
of the Eocene period constituted the four
large groups of Lemuravida, Condylarthra,
Esthonychida, and Ictopsida. These are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
four ancestral groups of the four main orders
of Placentalia&mdash;namely, of the Primates,
Ungulata, Rodentia, and Carnassia. They
seem to be so closely related by their primitive
organization that they may be united in
one common super-order, Prochoriata.</p>

<p>With a considerable degree of probability,
we are led to formulate the further
hypothesis that all the orders of Placentalia&mdash;from
the lowest Prochoriata upwards to
man&mdash;have descended from some unknown
common ancestor living in the Cretaceous
period, and that this oldest placental form
originated from some Jurassic group of
marsupials.</p>

<p>Among these numerous fossil Lemures
which have been discovered within the last
twenty years, there exist, indeed, all the connecting
forms of the older series of Primates,
all the 'missing links' sought for by comparative
odontology.</p>

<p>The oldest Lemures of the tertiary age
are the Eocene Pachylemures, or Hyopso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>dina.
They possess the complete dentition
of the Prochoriata&mdash;namely, forty-four teeth
(3.1.4.3/3.1.4.3). Then follow the Eocene Palæolemures,
or Adapida, with forty teeth, they
having lost one pair of incisors in each jaw.
To these are attached the younger Autolemures,
or Stenopida, with thirty-six teeth,
they thus possessing already the same dentition
as the Platyrrhinæ. The characteristic
dentition of the Catarrhinæ is derived from
this formula by the loss of another premolar.</p>

<p>These relations are so clear and so closely
connected with a gradual transformation of
the whole skull, and with the progressive
differentiation of the Primate-form, that we
are justified in saying that the pedigree of the
Primates, from the oldest Eocene Lemures
upwards to man, is now so well known, its
principal features so firmly fixed within the
Tertiary age, that there is no missing link
whatever.</p>

<p>Quite different, and much more incom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>plete,
is the palæontological evidence, if we
go further back into the Secondary or Mesozoic
age, and look there for the older ancestors
of the mammalian series. There we
meet everywhere with wide gaps, and the
scarce fragments of fossil Mesozoic mammals
(excessively rare in the Cretaceous formation)
are too poor to permit definite conclusions as
to their systematic position. Indeed, comparative
anatomy and ontogeny lead us to the
hypothesis that the oldest Cretaceous Mammalia&mdash;the
Prochoriata&mdash;are descended from
Jurassic marsupials, and these again from
Monotremes. We may also suppose with
high probability that among the unknown
Cretaceous Prochoriata there have been
Lemuravida and forms intermediate between
these and the Jurassic Amphitheriidæ, and
that these marsupials in their turn are descendants
of Pantotheria or similar monotreme-like
creatures of the Triassic age. Any
certain evidence for these hypotheses is at
present still wanting. One important fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
however, is established&mdash;namely, that these
interesting and oldest Mammalia&mdash;the Pantotheria
of Marsh, the Triassic Dromatheriidæ,
and the Jurassic Triconodontidæ of Osborn&mdash;were
small insectivorous mammals with a very
primitive organization. Probably they were
Monotremes, and may be derived directly
from Permian Sauromammalia, an ill-defined
mixture of Mammalia and Reptilia.</p>

<p>This generalized characteristic supports
our view that <i>the whole class of Mammalia is
monophyletic</i>, and that all its members, from
the oldest Monotremes upwards to man, have
descended from one common ancestor living
in the older Triassic, or perhaps in the
Permian, age. To acquire full conviction of
this important conception, we have only to
think of the hair and the glands of our
human skin, of our diaphragm, the heart and
the blood corpuscles without a nucleus, our
skull with its squamoso-mandibular articulation.
All these singular and striking modifications
of the vertebrate organization are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
common to mammals, and distinguish them
clearly from the other Craniota. This characteristic
combination and correlation proves
that they have been developed only <i>once</i> in
the history of the vertebrate stem, and that
they have been transferred by heredity from
one common ancestor to all the members of
the class of Mammalia.</p>

<p>The next step, as we trace our human
phylogeny to its origin, leads us further back
into the lower Vertebrata, into that obscure
Palæozoic age the immeasurable length of
which (much greater than that of the
Mesozoic) may, according to one of the
newest geological calculations, have comprised
about one thousand millions of years.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The first important fact we have to face
here is the complete absence of mammalian
remains. Instead of these we find in the
later Palæozoic period, the Permian, air-breathing
<i>reptiles</i> as the earliest representatives
of Amniota. They belong to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
most primitive order of that class, the
Tocosauria; and besides them there were
the Theromorpha, which approach the Mammalia
in a remarkable manner. These
reptiles in turn were preceded, in the Carboniferous
period, by true Amphibia, most
of them belonging to the armour-clad
Stegocephali. These interesting Progonamphibia
were the oldest Tetrapoda, the first
vertebrates which had adapted themselves
to the terrestrial mode of life; in them the
swimming fin of fishes and Dipneusta was
transformed into the pentadactyle extremities
characteristic of quadrupeds.</p>

<p>To appreciate the high importance of this
metamorphosis, we need only compare the
skeleton of our own human limbs with that
of the living Amphibia. We find in the
latter the same characteristic composition
as in man: the same shoulder and pelvic
girdle; the same single bone, the humerus
or the femur, followed by the same pair of
bones in the forearm and leg; then the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
skeletal elements composing the wrist and
the ankle regions; and, lastly, the same five
fingers and toes.</p>

<p>The arrangement of these bones, peculiar
and often complicated, but everywhere
essentially the same in all the Tetrapoda,
is a striking evidence that man is a
descendant from the oldest pentadactyle
Amphibia of the Carboniferous period. In
man the pentadactyle type has been better
preserved by constant heredity than in many
other Mammalia, notably the Ungulata.</p>

<p>The oldest Carboniferous Amphibia, the
armour-clad Stegocephali, and especially the
remarkable Branchiosauri discovered by
Credner, are now regarded by all competent
zoologists as the indubitable common ancestral
group of all Tetrapoda, comprising both
Amphibia and Amniota. But whence this
most remote group of Tetrapoda? That
difficult question is answered by the marvellous
progress of modern palæontology, and
the answer is in complete harmony with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
the older results arrived at by comparative
anatomy and ontogeny. Thirty-four years
ago Carl Gegenbaur,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> the great living master
of comparative anatomy, had demonstrated
in a series of works how the skeletal
parts of the various classes of Vertebrata,
especially the skull and the limbs, still represent
a continuous scale of phyletic gradations.
Apart from the Cyclostomes, there are the
fishes, and among them the Elasmobranchi
(sharks and rays), which have best preserved
the original structure in all its essential parts
of organization. Closely connected with the
Elasmobranchi are the Crossopterygii, and
with these the Dipneusta or Dipnoi. Among
the latter the highest importance attaches
to the ancient Australian Ceratodus. Its
organization and development is now, at
last, becoming well known. This transitional
group of Dipnoi, 'fishes with lungs'
but without pentadactyle limbs, is the
morphological bridge which joins the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Ganoids and the oldest Amphibia. With
this chain of successive groups of Vertebrata,
constructed anatomically, the palæontological
facts agree most satisfactorily.
Selachians and Ganoids existed in the
Silurian times, Dipnoi in the Devonian,
Amphibia in the Carboniferous, Reptilia in
the Permian, Mammalia in the Trias. These
are historical facts of first rank. They
connote in the most convincing manner that
remarkable ascending scale in the series of
vertebrates for our knowledge of which we
are indebted to the works of Cuvier and
Blainville, Meckel, Johannes Mueller and
Gegenbaur, Owen and Huxley. The historical
succession of the classes and orders
of the Vertebrata in the course of untold
millions of years is definitely fixed by the
concordance of those leading works, and this
invaluable acquisition is much more important
for the foundation of our human
pedigree than would be a complete series of
all possible skeletons of Primates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>Greater and more frequent difficulties
arise if we penetrate further into the most
remote part of the human phylogeny, and
attempt to derive the vertebrate stem from
an older stem of invertebrate ancestors.
None of those had a skeleton which could be
petrified; and the same remark applies to
the lowest classes of Vertebrata&mdash;to the
Cyclostomes and the Acrania. Palæontology,
therefore, can tell us nothing about them;
and we are limited to the other two great
documents of phylogeny&mdash;the results of comparative
anatomy and ontogeny. The value
of their evidence is, however, so great that
every competent zoologist can perceive the
most important features of the most remote
portion of our phylogeny.</p>

<p>Here the first place belongs to the invaluable
results which modern comparative
ontogeny has gained by the aid of the
biogenetic law or the theory of recapitulation.
The foundation-stones of vertebrate embryology
had been laid by the works of Von<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Baer, Bischoff,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Remak, and Koelliker;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> but
the clearest light was thrown upon it by the
famous discoveries of Kowalevsky<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> in 1866.
He proved the identity of the first developmental
stages of Amphioxus and
the Ascidians, and thereby confirmed the
divination of Goodsir, who had already
announced the close affinity of Vertebrates
and Tunicates. The acknowledgment of
this affinity has proved of increasing importance,
and has abolished the erroneous
hypothesis that the Vertebrata may have
arisen from Annelids or from other Articulata.
Meanwhile, from 1860 to 1872, I
myself had been studying the development
of the Spongiæ, Medusæ, Siphonophora, and
other C&oelig;lenterata. Their comparison led
me to the statements embodied in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
'Gastræatheorie,' the first abstract of which
was published in 1872 in my monograph of
the Calcispongiæ.</p>

<p>These ideas were carried on and expanded
during the subsequent ten years by
the help of many excellent embryologists&mdash;first
of all by E. Ray Lankester and Francis
Balfour. The most fruitful result of these
widely extended researches was the conclusion
that the first stages of embryonic
development are essentially the same in all
the different Metazoa, and that we may
derive from these facts certain views on the
common descent of all from one ancestral
form. The unicellular egg<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> repeats the stage
of our Protozoan ancestors; the Blastula is
equivalent to an ancestral c&oelig;nobium of
Magosphæra or Volvox; the Gastrula is
the hereditary repetition of the Gastræa, the
common ancestor of all the Metazoa.</p>

<p>Man agrees in all these respects with the
other vertebrates, and must have descended
with them from the same common root.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>Particularly obscure is that part of our
phylogeny which extends from the Gastræa
to Amphioxus. The morphological importance
of this last small creature had been
perceived by Johannes Mueller, who in 1842
gave the first accurate description of it. It
would not, of course, be correct to proclaim
the modern Amphioxus the common ancestor
of all the vertebrates; but he must be regarded
as closely related to them, and as the only
survivor of the whole class of Acrania. If
the Amphioxidæ had through some unfortunate
accident become extinct, we should
not have been able to gain anything like a
positive glimpse at our most remote vertebrate
ancestor. On the one hand, Amphioxus is
closely connected with the early larva of the
Cyclostomes, which are the oldest Craniota,
and the pre-Silurian ancestors of the fishes.
On the other hand, the ontogeny of Amphioxus
is in harmony with that of the Ascidians,
and if this agreement is not merely coincidental,
but due to relationship, we are
justified in reconstructing for both Ascidians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
and Amphioxus one common ancestral group
of chordate animals, the hypothetical <i>Prochordonia</i>.
The modern Copelata give us
a remote idea of their structure. The curious
Balanoglossus, the only living form of Enteropneusta,
seems to connect these Prochordonia
with the Nemertina and other Vermalia,
which we unite in one large class&mdash;Frontonia.</p>

<p>No doubt these pre-Cambrian Vermalia,
and the common root of all Metazoa, the
Gastræades, were connected during the
Laurentian period by a long chain of intermediate
forms, and probably among these
were some older forms of Rotatoria and
Turbellaria; but at present it is not possible
to fill this wide gap with hypotheses that
are satisfactory, and we have to admit that
here indeed are many missing links in the
older history of the Invertebrata. Still,
every zoologist who is convinced of the truth
of transformism, and is accustomed to phylogenetic
speculations, knows very well that
their results are most unequal, often incomplete.</p>

<h2>III.</h2>


<p>Let us now recapitulate the ancestral chain
of man, as it is set forth in the accompanying
diagram (p. <a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="label">55</a>), which represents our present
knowledge of our descent. For simplicity's
sake the many side-issues or branches which
lead to groups not in the main line of our
descent have been left out, or have been indicated
merely. Many of the stages are of
course hypothetical, arrived at by the study
of comparative anatomy and ontogeny; but
an example for each of them has been taken
from those living or fossil creatures which
seem to be their nearest representatives.</p>

<p>1. The most remote ancestors of all living
organisms were living beings of the simplest
imaginable kind, organisms without organs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
like the still existing <i>Monera</i>. Each consisted
of a simple granule of protoplasm, a
structureless mass of albuminous matter or
plasson, like the recent Chromaceæ and
Bacteriæ. The morphological value of these
beings is not yet that of a cell, but that of a
cytode, or cell without a nucleus. Cytoplasm
and nucleus were still undifferentiated.</p>

<p>I assume that the first Monera owe their
existence to spontaneous creation out of so-called
anorganic combinations, consisting of
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. An
explanation of this hypothesis I have given
in my 'Generelle Morphologie.'</p>

<p>The Monera probably arose early in the
Laurentian period. The oldest are the
Phytomonera, with vegetable metabolism.
They possessed the power (characteristic of
plants) of forming albumin by synthesis from
carbon, water, and ammonia. From some of
these plasma-forming Monera arose the
plasmophagous Zoomonera with animal metabolism,
living directly upon the produce of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
their plasmodomous or plasma-forming
sisters. This is the first instance of the
great principle of division of labour.</p>

<p>2. The second stage is that of the <i>simple
and single cell</i>, a bit of protoplasm with a
nucleus. Such unicellular organisms are
still very common. The <i>Am&oelig;bæ</i> are their
simplest representatives. The morphological
value of such beings is the same as that of
the egg of any animal. The naked egg cells
of the sponges creep about in an am&oelig;boid
fashion, scarcely distinguishable from Am&oelig;ba.
The same remark applies to the egg-cell of
man himself in its early stages before it is
enclosed in a membrane. The first unicellular
organisms arose from Monera through differentiation
of the inner nucleus from the outer
protoplasm.</p>

<p>3. Repeated division of the unicellular
organism produces the <i>Synam&oelig;bium</i>, or
community of Am&oelig;bæ, provided the divisional
products, or new generations of the
original cell, do not scatter, but remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
together. The existence of such a <i>C&oelig;nobium</i>,
a number of equal and only loosely-connected
cells, as a separate stage in the ancestral
history of animals, is made highly probable by
the fact that the eggs of all animals undergo
after fertilization such a process of repeated
self-division, or 'cleavage,' until the single
egg cell is transformed into a heap of cells
closely packed together, not unlike a mulberry
(<i>morula</i>)&mdash;hence <i>morula</i> stage in ontogeny.</p>

<p>4. The morula of most animals further
changes into a <i>Blastula</i>, a hollow ball filled
with fluid, the wall being formed by a single
layer of cells, the blastoderm or germinal layer.
This modification is brought about by the
action of the cells&mdash;they conveying nourishing
fluid into the interior of the whole cell
colony and thereby being themselves forced
towards the surface. The Blastula of most
Invertebrata, and even that of Amphioxus, is
possessed of fine ciliæ, or hair-like processes,
the vibrating motion of which causes the
whole organism to rotate and advance in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
the water. Living representatives of such
Blastæads, namely, globular gelatinous
colonies of cells enclosing a cavity, are
Volvox and Magosphæra.</p>

<p>5. The Blastula of most animals assumes
a new larval form called <i>Gastrula</i>, in which
the essential characteristics are that a portion
of the blastoderm by invagination converts
the Blastula into a cup with double walls,
enclosing a new cavity, the primitive gut.
This invagination or bulging-in obliterates
the original inner cavity of the Blastula.
The outer layer of the Gastrula is the ectoderm,
the inner the endoderm; both pass
into each other at the blastoporus, or opening
of the gut cavity. The Gastrula is a stage
in the embryonic development of the various
great groups of animals, and some such
primitive form as ancestral to all Metazoa is
thus indicated. This hypothetical <i>Gastræa</i>
is still very essentially represented by the
lower C&oelig;lenterates&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, Olynthus, Hydra.</p>

<p>6. The sixth stage&mdash;that of the <i>Platodes</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
or flat-worms&mdash;is very hypothetical. They
are bilateral gastræads, with a flattened
oblong body, furnished with ciliæ, with a
primitive nervous system, simple sensory and
reproductive organs, but still without appendages,
body cavity, vent, and blood-vessels.
The nearest living representatives of such
creatures are the ac&oelig;lous Turbellarians&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>,
Convoluta, a free-swimming, ciliated creature.</p>

<p>7. The next higher stage is represented
by such low animals as the <i>Gastrotricha</i>&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>,
Chætonotus among the Rotatoria, which
differ from the rhabdoc&oelig;lous Turbellarians
chiefly by the formation of a vent and the
beginnings of a c&oelig;lom, or cavity, between
gut and body wall. The addition of a primitive
vascular system and a pair of nephridia,
or excretory organs, is first met with in the
<i>Nemertines</i>.</p>

<p>8. These, together with the <i>Enteropneusta</i>
(Balanoglossus), are comprised under the
name of Frontonia, or Rhynchelminthes,
and form the highest group of the Vermalia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>The Enteropneusta especially fix our attention,
because they alone, although essentially
'worms,' exhibit certain characteristics which
make it possible to bridge over the gulf
which still separates the Invertebrata from
the vertebrate phylum. The anterior portion
of the gut is transformed into a breathing
apparatus&mdash;hence Gegenbaur's term of Enteropneusta,
or Gut-breathers. Moreover,
Balanoglossus and Cephalodiscus possess
another modification of the gut&mdash;namely, a
peculiar diverticulum, which, in the present
state of our knowledge, may be looked upon
as the forerunner of the chorda dorsalis.</p>

<p>9. Stage of <i>Prochordonia</i>, as indicated by
the larval form, called Chordula, which is
common to the Tunicata and all the Vertebrata.
These two groups possess three most
important features: (<i>a</i>) A chorda dorsalis,
a stiff rod lying in the long axis of the
body, dorsally from the gut and below the
central nervous system. This latter, for the
first time in the animal kingdom, appears in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
the shape of a spinal cord. (<i>b</i>) The use of
the anterior portion of the gut for respiratory
purposes. (<i>c</i>) The larval development of
the Tunicata is essentially the same as that of
the Vertebrata in its early stages. Only the
free-swimming Copelata or Appendicularia
among the Tunicates retain most of these
features. The others, which become sessile&mdash;namely,
the Ascidiæ, or sea-squirts&mdash;degenerate
and specialize away from the
main line.</p>

<p>10. Stage of the <i>Acrania</i>, represented by
Amphioxus. The early development of this
little marine creature agrees closely with that
of the Tunicates; but one important feature
is added to its organization&mdash;namely, metamerism,
segmentally arranged mesoderm.
Amphioxus still possesses neither skull nor
vertebræ, neither ribs nor jaws, and no limbs.
But it is a member of the Vertebrata if we
define these as follows: Bilateral symmetrical
animals with segmentally arranged mesoderm,
with a chorda dorsalis between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
tubular nervous system and the gut, and with
respiratory organs which arise from the anterior
portion of the gut. We do not assume
that Amphioxus stands in the direct ancestral
line; it is probably much specialized, partly
degenerated, and represents a side-branch;
but it is, nevertheless, the only creature,
hitherto known, which satisfactorily connects
the Vertebrata with their invertebrate ancestors.
Many other efforts have been made to
solve the mystery of the origin of the Vertebrata&mdash;all
less satisfactory than the present
suggestion, or even absolutely futile. This
remark applies especially to the attempts
to derive them from either Articulata or
Echinoderms. The other great and highly
developed phylum, the Mollusca, is quite
out of the question. We have to go back to
a level at which all these principal phyla
meet, and there we find the Vermalia, the
lower of which alone permit connection in an
upward direction with the higher phyla.</p>

<p>11. Stage of <i>Cyclostomata</i>. This now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
small group of Lampreys and Hagfishes
represents the lowest Craniota; and although
much specialized as a side-branch of the
main-stem from which the other Craniota
have sprung, they give us an idea of what
the direct ancestors of the latter must have
been like:&mdash;still without visceral arches,
without jaws and without paired limbs; with
a persistent pronephros; the ear with one
semicircular canal only; mouth suctorial;
cranium very primitive; and the metamerism
of the vertebral column indicated only by
little blocks of cartilage in the perichordal
sheath. Such creatures must have existed
at least as early as the Lower Silurian
epoch; but until 1890 fossil Cyclostomes were
unknown. Their life in the mud, or as
endoparasites of fishes, coupled with their
soft structure, makes them very unfit for
preservation. This gives all the greater importance
to Traquair's discovery, in 1890, of
many little creatures, called by him <i>Palæospondylus
gunni</i>, in the Old Red Sandstone of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Caithness, which seem to be very closely
allied to Cyclostomata.</p>

<p>12. The <i>Elasmobranchi</i> (sharks and skates),
with their immediate forerunners, the Acanthodi
of the Devonian and Carboniferous age,
are the first typical fishes. That they existed
as far back as the Silurian age is proved by
many enamelled spines of the dermal armour,
chiefly from the dorsal fins. This higher
stage is characterized by the possession of
typical jaws, by visceral or gill-bearing arches,
and by two pairs of limbs. None of the
Elasmobranchs, fossil or recent, stands in the
direct ancestral line; but they are the lowest
Gnathostomata, jaw-and-limb-possessing
creatures, known.</p>

<p>13. Closely connected with the Elasmobranchs
in a wider sense are the <i>Crossopterygii</i>,
which begin in the Devonian age as a
large group, but have left only two survivals,
the African Polypterus and Calamoichthys.
They are possessed of dermal bones and
other ossifications, and are characterized by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
their lobate paired fins, which have a thick
axis beset with biserial fin rays. Their gill-clefts
are covered by an operculum, and they
have a well-developed air-bladder. Whilst
they are in many respects more highly
developed than the Elasmobranchs, and are
intimately connected with the typical Ganoids
and other bony fishes (all of which form a
great, manifold side-branch of the general
vertebrate stem), they stand in many other
respects (notably, the structure of the paired
fins, the vertebral column, and the air-bladder)
nearer the main-stem of our own
ancestral line.</p>

<p>14. This is shown by their intimate
relation to the <i>Dipnoi</i>, which are still represented
by the Australian, African, and South
American mud-fishes: Ceratodus, Protopterus,
and Lepidosiren. The genus Ceratodus
existed in the Upper Trias, whence various
other unmistakably dipnoous forms lead down
through the Carboniferous (<i>e.g.</i>, Ctenodus)
to the Devonian strata&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, Dipterus. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
are characterized as follows: The paired fins
still retain the archipterygial form (namely,
one axis with biserial rays); the heart is
already trilocular, and receives blood which
is mixed arterial and venous, owing to the
gills being retained, while the air-bladder has
been modified into a lung. In fact, the
generalized Dipnoi form the actual link between
fishes and <i>Amphibia</i>.</p>

<p>15. <i>Amphibia.</i> The earliest amphibian
fossils occur in the Carboniferous strata.
They alone&mdash;the Stegocephali or Phractamphibia&mdash;stand
in the ancestral line, while the
Lissamphibia, to which all the recent forms
belong, are side-branches. The Stegocephali
are the earliest Tetrapoda, the archipterygial
paired fins having been transformed into
the pentadactyle fore and hind limbs, which
are so characteristic of all the higher Vertebrata.
The cranium is roofed over by dermal
bones, of which, besides others, supra-occipitals,
supra-orbitals, and supra-temporals
are always present. The lowest members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
(Branchiosauri) still retained gills besides
the lungs, while others (Microsauri) have
lost the gills. Be it remembered that all the
recent Amphibia still undergo the same metamorphosis
during their ontogenetic development.</p>

<p>In the very important Temnospondyli, a
subgroup of the Stegocephali&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, Trimerorhachis
of the Lower Red Sandstone or Lower
Permian&mdash;the component cartilaginous or
bony units which compose the vertebræ still
remained in a separate, unfused state, showing
at the same time an arrangement whence
has arisen that which is typical of the Amniota.
The same applies to the limbs and
their girdles. In fact, the Stegocephali, taken
as a whole, lead imperceptibly to the <i>Proreptilia</i>.</p>

<p>16. <i>Proreptilia</i> are represented by the
Permian genera Eryops and Cricotus. Until
quite recently these and many other fossils
from the Carboniferous strata were looked
upon as Amphibia, while many undoubted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
fossil Amphibia were mistaken for reptiles,
as indicated by the frequent termination
'-saurus' in their names.</p>

<p>The nearest living representative of these
extinct Proreptilia is the New Zealand
reptile Hatteria, or Sphenodon, close relations
of which are known from the Upper Trias;
while others&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, Palæohatteria&mdash;have been
discovered in the Permian. Anyhow, Sphenodon
is the reptile which stands nearest to the
main stem of our ancestry.</p>

<p>The most important characteristics of the
Reptilia, which mark a higher stage or level,
are (1) The entire suppression of the gills&mdash;although
during the embryonic development
the gill-clefts still appear in all reptiles, birds,
and mammals; (2) The development of an
amnion and an allantois, both for the embryonic
life only, but so characteristic that all
these animals are comprised under the name
of Amniota; (3) The articulation of the skull
with the first neck vertebræ by well-developed
condyles, either single (really triple) or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
double (such a condylar arrangement begins
with the Amphibia, but only the two lateral
condyles are developed, while the middle
portion, belonging to the basi-occipital element,
remains rudimentary<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>); (4) The formation
of centra, or bodies of the vertebræ,
mainly by a ventral pair of the original quadruple
constituents, or arcualia.</p>

<p>17. Between the Proreptilia and the Mammalia,
which latter occur in the Upper Triassic
epoch, we have necessarily to intercalate a
group of very low reptiles, which are still so
generalized that their descendants could
branch off either into the Reptilia proper or
into the Mammalia. The changes concerned
chiefly the brain and the heart; of the skele<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>ton,
the skull and the pelvis; and, of the
tegumentary structures, the formation of a
hairy covering. Many such creatures existed
in the Triassic epoch&mdash;namely, the <i>Theromorpha</i>&mdash;some
of which indeed possess so
many characteristics which otherwise occur
in the Mammalia only, that these creatures
have been termed <i>Sauro-Mammalia</i>. However,
it has to be emphasized that none of
the Theromorpha hitherto discovered fulfils
all the requirements which would entitle them
to this important linking position. They only
give us an approximate idea of what this link
was like.</p>

<p>18. Stage of the <i>Promammalia</i>, or <i>Prototheria</i>.
The only surviving members are
the famous duck-bill, Ornithorhynchus, and
the spiny ant-eaters, Echidna and Proechidna,
of the Australian region. These few genera,
however, differ so much from one another in
various important respects that they cannot
but be remnants of an originally much larger
group. Indeed, many fossils from the Upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Triassic and from the Jurassic strata have
without much doubt to be referred to the
Prototheria. The Prototheria are typical
mammals, because they possess the following
characteristics: The heart is completely
quadrilocular; the blood is warm, and its red
corpuscles have, owing to the loss of their
nucleus, been modified from biconvex into
biconcave discs; they have a hairy coat and
sweat glands, and two occipital condyles; the
ilio-sacral connection is preacetabular; the
ankle-joint is cruro-tarsal; the quadrate bone
of the Reptilia has ceased to carry the under
jaw, which now articulates directly with the
squamosal portion of the skull. Their low
position is shown by the retention of the
following reptilian features: Complete coracoid
bones and a T-shaped interclavicle; a
cloaca, or common chamber for the passage
of the fæces, the genital and the urinary products;
they are still oviparous; the embryo
develops without a chorion, and is therefore
not nourished through a placenta. Even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
milk glands, which are absolutely peculiar to
the Mammalia, are still in a very primitive
stage, and do not yet produce milk proper;
and there is only a temporary shallow marsupium.</p>

<p>19. Stage of <i>Metatheria</i>, or <i>Marsupialia</i>,
are direct descendants of Prototheria; but
they show higher development by the reduction
of the coracoid bones and the interclavicle.
The original cloaca is divided into
a rectal chamber and a uro-genital sinus, completely
separated, at least in the males; they
are viviparous; the young are received into
a permanent marsupium, in the walls of which
are formed typical milk glands and nipples,
but the embryo is still devoid of a placenta,
although some recent marsupials show indications
of such an organ. The corpus callosum
in the brain is still very weak.</p>

<p>Most of the marsupials are extinct. They
occur from the Upper Trias onwards, and
had in the Jurassic epoch attained a wide
distribution both in Europe and in America.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Since the Tertiary epoch they have been
restricted to America and to the Australian
region, and are now represented by about 150
species.</p>

<p>20. Stage of <i>Prochoriata</i>, or early <i>Placentalia</i>:
a further development of the Metatheria
by the development of a placenta, loss
of the marsupium and the marsupial bones,
complete division by the perineum of the
anal and uro-genital chambers, stronger
development of the corpus callosum, or chief
commissure of the two hemispheres of the
brain.</p>

<p>Placentalia must have come into existence
during the Cretaceous epoch. Up to that
time all the Mammalia seem to have
belonged to either Prototheria or to Metatheria;
but in the early Eocene we can
distinguish the main groups of Placentalia&mdash;namely,
(1) Trogontia, now represented by
the rodents; (2) Edentata, or sloths, armadilloes,
etc.; (3) Carnassia, or Insectivora
and Carnivora; (4) Chiroptera, or bats;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
(5) Cetomorpha, or whales and dugongs;
(6) Ungulata; (7) Primates. Of these
groups, the first and second, third and fourth,
fifth and sixth, can perhaps, to judge from
palæontological evidence, be combined into
three greater groups, as indicated by the
fossil Esthonychida, Ictopsida, and Condylarthra,
in addition to the ancestral Primates,
or Lemuravida, as the fourth large branch of
the ancestral-tree where this has reached the
placental level. Among none of the first
three branches can we look for the ancestors
of the Primates. The Lemuravida, therefore,
represent a branch equivalent to the three
other branches.</p>

<p>21. Stage of <i>Lemures</i>, or <i>Prosimiæ</i>, comprising
the older members of the Primates,
consequently approaching most nearly to the
Lemuravida. The limbs are modified into
pentadactyle hands and feet of the arboreal
type, and are protected by nails. The dentition
is of the frugivorous or omnivorous type,
with an originally complete series of teeth,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>with milk teeth and with permanent. The
orbit is surrounded by a complete bony ring,
posteriorly by a fronto-jugal arch, but still
widely communicating with the temporal
fossa. The placenta is diffuse and non-deciduous.</p>

</p>

<p>22. Stage of <i>Simiæ</i>. Orbit completely
separated from the temporal fossa by an
inward extension of the frontal and malar
bones meeting the alisphenoid. Placenta consolidated
into a disc, and with a maternal
deciduous portion. Mammæ pectoral only.
The dental formula is 2.1.3.3. All the
fingers and toes are protected by flat nails.
The tail is long. The American prehensile-tailed
monkeys are a lower side-branch.</p>

<p>23. Stage of <i>Catarrhinæ Cercopithecidæ</i>.
The dental formula is 2.1.2.3, owing to the
loss of one pair of premolars in each jaw.
The frontal and alisphenoid bones are in
contact, separating the parietal from the
malar bone; this feature is correlated with
the enlarged brain. The internarial septum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
is narrow, and the nostrils look forwards and
downwards instead of sidewards&mdash;hence the
term 'Catarrhinæ.' The external auditory
meatus is long and bony. The tail is long,
with the exception of <i>Macacus inuus</i>. The
body is covered with a thick coat of furry
hair. Catarrhine monkeys have existed, we
know with certainty, since the Miocene.</p>

<p>24. Stage of <i>Catarrhinæ Anthropoidæ</i>, or
<i>Apes</i>. Now represented by the large apes&mdash;namely,
the Hylobates or gibbon of South-Eastern
Asia, <i>Simia satyrus</i>, the orang-utan
of Sumatra and Borneo, <i>Troglodytes gorilla</i>,
<i>T. niger</i> and <i>T. calvus</i>, the gorilla and the
chimpanzees from Western Equatorial Africa.
Of fossils are to be mentioned Pliopithecus
and Dryopithecus from European Miocene,
and <i>Troglodytes sivalensis</i> from the Pliocene
of the Punjaub. The tail is reduced to a
few caudal vertebræ, which are transformed
into a coccyx, not visible externally; but in
the embryos of apes and man the tail is still
a conspicuous feature. The walk is semi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>erect;
in adaptation to the prevailing arboreal
life, the arms are longer than the legs.
The hair of the body is considerably more
scanty than in the tailed monkeys. <i>Troglodytes
calvus</i>, a species or variety of chimpanzee,
is bald-headed. None of the recent
genera of apes can lay claim to a place in
the ancestry of mankind.</p>

<p>25. Stage of <i>Pithecanthropi</i>. Hitherto the
only known representative is <i>Pithecanthropus
erectus</i>, from the Upper Pliocene of Java. In
adaptation to a more erect gait, the legs have
become stronger and the hind-hand has been
turned into a flat-soled walking 'foot.' The
brain is considerably enlarged. Presumably
it is still devoid of so-called articulate speech;
this is indicated by the fact that children
have to learn the language of their parents,
and by the circumstance that comparative
philology declares it impossible to reduce the
chief human languages to anything like one
common origin.</p>

<p>26. <i>Man.</i> Known with certainty to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
existed as an implement-using creature in the
last Glacial epoch. His probable origin
cannot, therefore, have been later than the
beginning of the Plistocene. The place of
origin was probably somewhere in Southern
Asia.</p>

<p>Whilst we have to admit that there are
great defects in the older (invertebrate)
portion of our pedigree, we have all the more
reason to be satisfied with the positive results
of our investigation of the more recent (vertebrate)
part of it. All modern researches have
confirmed the views of Lamarck, Darwin, and
Huxley, and they allow of no doubt that the
nearest vertebrate ancestors of mankind were
a series of Tertiary Primates.</p>

<p>Particularly valuable are the admirable
attempts of the two zoologists, Paul and Fritz
Sarasin,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> to throw light upon the human
phylogeny by painstaking comparison of all
the skeletal parts of man with those of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
anthropoid apes. They have shown that
among the lower races of man the primitive
Veddahs of Ceylon approach the apes most
nearly, and that among the latter the chimpanzee
stands nearest to man.</p>

<p>The direct descent of man from some
extinct ape-like form is now beyond doubt,
and admits of being traced much more clearly
than the origin of many another mammalian
order. The pedigrees of the Elephants,
the Sirenia, the Cetacea, and, above all, of
the Edentata, for example, are much more
obscure and difficult to explain. In many
parts of their organization&mdash;for example, in
the number and structure of his five digits and
toes&mdash;man and monkeys have remained much
more primitive than most of the Ungulata.</p>

<p>The immense significance of this positive
knowledge of the origin of man from some
Primate does not require to be enforced. Its
bearing upon the highest questions of philosophy
cannot be exaggerated. Among modern
philosophers no one has perceived this more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
deeply than Herbert Spencer.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> He is one of
those older thinkers who before Darwin were
convinced that the theory of development
is the only way to solve the 'enigma of the
world.' Spencer is also the champion of those
evolutionists who lay the greatest weight
upon <i>progressive heredity</i>, or the much combated
<i>heredity of acquired characters</i>. From
the first he has severely attacked and criticised
the theories of Weismann, who denies
this most important factor of phylogeny, and
would explain the whole of transformism by
the 'all-sufficiency of selection.' In England
the theories of Weismann were received with
enthusiastic acclamation, much more so than
on the Continent, and they were called 'Neo-Darwinism,'
in opposition to the older conception
of Evolution, or 'Neo-Lamarckism.'
Neither of those expressions is correct.
Darwin himself was convinced of the fundamental
importance of progressive heredity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
quite as much as his great predecessor
Lamarck; as were also Huxley and Spencer.</p>

<p>Three times I had the good fortune to
visit Darwin at Down, and on each occasion
we discussed this fundamental question in
complete harmony. I agree with Spencer
in the conviction that progressive heredity is
an indispensable factor in every true monistic
theory of Evolution, and that it is one of its
most important elements. If one denies
with Weismann the heredity of acquired
characters, then it becomes necessary to have
recourse to purely mystical qualities of germ-plasm.
I am of the opinion of Spencer, that
in that case it would be better to accept a
mysterious creation of all the various species
as described in the Mosaic account.</p>

<p>If we look at the results of modern anthropogeny
from the highest point of view, and
compare all its empirical arguments, we are
justified in affirming that <i>the descent of man
from an extinct Tertiary series of Primates
is not a vague hypothesis, but an historical fact</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course, this fact cannot be proved
<i>exactly</i>. We cannot explain all the innumerable
physical and chemical processes,
all the physiological mutations, which have
led during untold millions of years from the
simplest Monera and from the unicellular
Protista upwards to the chimpanzee and to
man. But the same consideration applies to
all historical facts. We all believe that
Aristotle, Cæsar, and King Alfred did live;
but it is impossible to give a proof within
the meaning of modern exact science. We
believe firmly in the former existence of
these and other great heroes of thought,
because we know well the works they have
left behind them, and we see their effects in
the history of human culture. These indirect
arguments do not furnish stronger evidence
than those of our history as vertebrates.
We know of many Jurassic mammals only
a single bone, the under jaw. We all
believe that these mammals possessed also
an upper jaw, a skull, and other bones. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the so-called 'exact school,' which regards
the transformation of species as a hypothesis
not proven, must suppose that the
mandibula was the only bone in the body of
these curious animals.</p>

<p>Looking forward to the twentieth century,
I am convinced that it will universally accept
our theory of descent, and that future science
will regard it as the greatest advance made
in our time. I have no doubt that the
influence of the study of anthropogeny upon
all other branches of science will be fruitful
and auspicious. The work done in the
present century by Lamarck and Darwin
will in all future times be considered one
of the greatest conquests made by thinking
man.</p>

<h2>BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES</h2>


<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Footnote_40" id="Footnote_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40">Jean Baptiste de Monet</a>, Chevalier de
<a name="Footnote_44" id="Footnote_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44">Lamarck</a></span>, was born on August 1, 1744, in
Picardy, where his father owned land.
Originally educated for the Church, he
soon enlisted, and distinguished himself in
active service. Owing to an accident affecting
his health, the young Lieutenant gave
up the military career, and, without means,
studied medicine and natural sciences at
Paris. In 1778 appeared his 'Flore française.'
In 1793 he was appointed to a
Chair of Zoology at the newly-formed Musée
d'Histoire Naturelle. He had the misfortune
to become gradually blind, and the last years
of his life were spent amid straitened circumstances.
He died in 1829.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1794 Lamarck divided the whole animal
kingdom into vertebrate and invertebrate
animals, and founded successively the groups
of Crustacea, Arachnida, Annelida, and
Radiata. Between 1816 and 1822 he published
his celebrated 'Histoire naturelle des
Animaux sans Vertèbres.'</p>

<p>His most famous work is the 'Philosophie
zoologique,' 1809.</p>

<p>Assuming the spontaneous origin of life,
he propounded the doctrine that all animals
and plants have arisen from low forms
through incessant modifications and changes.
In this respect he was in absolute opposition
to Cuvier, who upheld the immutability of
species, and did his best by absolute silence
to suppress the spread of the new doctrine.</p>

<p>Lamarck has explained his views of transformism
chiefly in the seventh chapter of the
first volume of his 'Philosophie zoologique.'</p>

<p>Organisms strive to accommodate or adapt
themselves to new circumstances, or to satisfy
new requirements&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, climate, mode of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
procuring food, escape from enemies. The
continued function of parts of an organism
changes the old and produces new organs.
The acquirements are inherited by the offspring,
and thus are produced the more complicated
from simpler organisms. Continued
disuse brings about degeneration and ultimate
loss of an organ.</p>

<p>Lamarck consequently sees in the adaptability,
or power of adaptation, which he
assumes for all living matter the ultimate
cause of variation; and, as he was certainly
the first to point out that acquired characters
are inherited by the progeny, he has given
a working explanation of Evolution.</p>

<p>But his doctrine did not spread&mdash;partly
because he was misunderstood. His theory,
that a new want, by making itself felt, exacts
from the animal new exertions, perhaps from
parts hitherto not used, until the want is
satisfied&mdash;this way of putting it sounds too
teleological to explain the yearned-for change
in a mechanical or natural way. Moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
many of his examples lacked the exact basis
of experiment and observation necessary for
their acceptance. Witness that of the neck of
the giraffe,&mdash;a never-failing source of ridicule
to men who cannot see the deeper purpose
underlying the well-meant attempt at an explanation,
which failed from want of complete
knowledge of the intricate circumstances.</p>

<p>However, the theory of transformism was,
so to speak, in the air; and various authors
have written on the subject, filling the gap
between Lamarck and Darwin, especially
Goethe, Treviranus, Leopold von Buch,
and Herbert Spencer. But it is Darwin's
immortal merit to have opened our eyes by
his theory of natural selection, which is, at
least, the first attempt to explain some of the
causes and incidents of organic Evolution
in a natural mechanical way. Moreover, he
was the first clearly to express the fundamental
principles of the theory of descent, to
elaborate what had been at best a general
sketch of an ill-defined problem, and to enter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
into detail, supported by a host of painstaking
observations, the making of which had
taken him half a lifetime. Darwin, without
going further than cursorily into the causes
of variation, argued as follows: We know
that variations do occur in every kind of
living creatures. Some of these variations
lead to something, while others do not. An
enormously greater number of animals and
plants are born than reach maturity and can
in their turn continue the race. What is the
regulating factor? His answer is, The
struggle for existence&mdash;in other words, the
weeding out of the less fit, or rather of the
owners of those variations which are not so
well adapted to their surroundings.</p>

<p>For 'adapted' we had better read 'adaptable,'
because a variation which does not
answer, which cannot be made use of, or,
still more notably, is a hindrance or disadvantage,
does not become an adapted
feature. There is often a confusion between
adaptation as an accomplished fact, a feature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
or resultant condition, and adaptation as the
mode of fitting the organism to, or making
the best of, the prevailing surroundings or
circumstances.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire</span> was
born in 1772 at Étampes, Seine-et-Oise.
He was originally brought up for the Church;
but when already ordained he attended
lectures on natural science and medicine in
Paris. He managed to get the place of
assistant in the Musée d'Histoire Naturelle;
he became Professor of Zoology in 1793, and
took the opportunity of encouraging young
Cuvier. Later he became Professor of
Zoology of the Faculté des Sciences, and in
1818 he published his remarkable 'Philosophie
anatomique.' He died in 1844.</p>

<p>He had conceived the 'unity of organic
composition,' meaning that there is only one
plan of construction,&mdash;the same principle, but
varied in its accessory parts. In 1830, when
Geoffroy proceeded to apply to the Inverte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>brata
his views as to the uniformity of
animal composition, he found a vigorous
opponent in Cuvier. Geoffroy, like Goethe,
held that there is in Nature a law of compensation,
or balancing of growth, so that if
one organ take on an excess of development,
it is at the expense of another part; and he
maintained that, since Nature takes no
sudden leaps, even organs which are superfluous
in any given species, if they have
played an important part in other species of
the same family, are retained as rudiments,
which testify to the permanence of the
general plan of creation. It was his conviction
that, owing to the conditions of life,
the same forms had <i>not</i> been perpetuated
since the origin of all things, although it was
not his belief that existing species were becoming
modified. Cuvier, on the other
hand, maintained the absolute invariability
of species, which, he declared, had been
created with regard to the circumstances in
which they were placed, each organ con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>trived
with a view to the function it had to
fulfil,&mdash;thus putting the effect for the cause

<p><span class="smcap">George <a name="Footnote_46" id="Footnote_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46">Cuvier</a></span>
in the department of Doubs, which
at that time belonged to Württemberg. He
was educated at Stuttgart, and studied
political economy. While acting as private
tutor to a French family in France he
followed his favourite pursuit, the study of
natural sciences. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire
heard of him, and appointed him assistant in
the department of comparative anatomy in the
Musée d'Histoire Naturelle. In 1799 he was
elected Professor of Natural History at the
Collège de France, and soon after he became
Perpetual Secretary of the Institut National.
In 1831, a year before his death, Louis
Philippe raised him to the rank of a peer of
France.</p>

<p>Cuvier was the first to indicate the true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
principle upon which the natural classification
of animals should be based&mdash;namely,
their structure. It is the study of the
anatomy of the creatures and their comparison
which affords the only sound basis
of a classification. The work which had the
greatest influence upon the scientific public
is his 'Règne animal distribué d'après son
Organisation,' 1817. The system which he
propounded in this book gradually came to
have almost world-wide fame, and, in spite
of its many obvious deficiencies, still lingers
in some of our most recent text-books.</p>

<p>A standard work is his 'Leçons d'Anatomie
comparée,' and, in truth, he is the founder
of that kind of comparative anatomy which
was brought to such a high state by his
pupil, the late Sir Richard Owen. Cuvier
discovered the law of 'correlation of growth,'
and was the first to apply this law to the
reconstruction of animals from fragments:
see his monumental work entitled 'Recherches
sur les Ossemens fossiles,' 1812.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>Cuvier, however, as a strict matter-of-fact
man, was incapable of appreciating the speculative
conclusions which were drawn by his
contemporaries Saint-Hilaire and Lamarck.
On the contrary, he firmly stuck to the
doctrine of the immutability of species; and,
in order to account for the existence of
animals whose kind exists no longer, he invented
the famous doctrine of successive
cataclysms.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Karl Ernst <a name="Footnote_41" id="Footnote_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41">von Baer</a></span>
was born in 1792
in Esthonia, studied at Dorpat and then at
Würzburg, where Döllinger introduced him
to comparative anatomy. For a few years
he was a <i>Privat-docent</i> at Berlin; then he
went to Königsberg as Professor of Zoology
and Embryology. In 1834 he became an
Academician at St. Petersburg, where for
many years he was occupied with the most
varied studies, chiefly geographical and
ethnological. The last years of his long,
active life he spent in contemplative retire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>ment
on his paternal estate, and he died at
Dorpat in 1876.</p>

<p>While still at Würzburg he induced his
friend Pander, a young man of means, to study
the development of the chick; and Pander was
the first to start the theory of the germinal
layers from which all the organs arise.
Baer, however, continued these researches in
Königsberg, and after nine years' labour produced
his epoch-making work, 'Ueber Entwicklungsgeschichte
der Thiere: Beobachtung
und Reflexion,' Königsberg, 1828. Nine
years later he completed the second volume.
He established upon a firm basis the theory
of the germinal layers, and by further 'reflexions'
arrived at the elucidation of some of
the most fundamental laws of biology. For
example, in the first volume he made the
following prophetic statement: 'Perhaps all
animals are alike, and nothing but hollow
globes at their earliest developmental beginning.
The farther back we trace their
development, the more resemblance we find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
in the most different creatures. And this
leads to the question whether at the beginning
of their development all animals are essentially
alike, and referable to one common ancestral
form. Considering that the "germ" (which
at a certain stage appears in the shape of a
hollow globe or bag) is the undeveloped animal
itself, we are not without reason for assuming
that the common fundamental form is that of a
simple vesicle, from which every animal is
evolved, not only theoretically, but historically.'</p>

<p>This statement is all the more wonderful
when we consider that the cells, the all-composing
individual units, were not discovered
until ten years later.</p>

<p>In 1829 Baer discovered the human egg,
and later the chorda dorsalis. In an address
delivered in 1834, entitled 'The Most Universal
Law of Nature in all Development,' he
explained that only from a most superficial
point of view can the various species be looked
upon as permanent and immutable types;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
that, on the contrary, they can be nothing
but passing stages, or series of stages, of
development, which have been evolved by
transformation out of common ancestral forms.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Johannes Mueller</span>, born at Coblenz in
1801, established himself as <i>Privat-docent</i> at
Bonn, where in 1830 he became Professor of
Physiology. In 1833 he accepted the Chair
of Anatomy and Physiology at Berlin, where
he died in 1858.</p>

<p>He was one of the most distinguished
physiologists and comparative anatomists.
By summarizing the labours and discoveries
already made in the field of physiology, by
reducing them to order, and abstracting the
general principles, he became the founder of
modern physiology. But he was scarcely
less distinguished by his researches in
comparative anatomy. His 'Vergleichende
Anatomie der Myxinoiden,' in <i>Abhandlungen
der Berliner Akademie</i>, 1835-45, and 'Ueber
die Grenzen der Ganoiden' (<i>ibid.</i>, 1846), are
standard works of lasting value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>Mueller exercised a stimulative influence
as a teacher. Many well-known men&mdash;such
as Helmholtz, Gegenbaur, Bruecke the physiologist,
Guenther the zoologist, Virchow the
pathologist, Koelliker and Haeckel&mdash;have
been his pupils.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Rudolph <a name="Footnote_45" id="Footnote_45"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45">Virchow</a></span>
Schievelbein, a small town in Eastern
Pomerania. He studied medicine in Berlin
as a pupil of Johannes Mueller, and went
in 1849 to Würzburg, where, under the
influence of Koelliker, and Leydig the pathologist,
he laid the foundation of an entirely
new branch of medical science&mdash;that of
'cellular pathology.' Since 1856 he has
filled the principal Chair of Pathology at
Berlin. In 1892 he received the Copley
medal of the Royal Society.</p>

<p>'His contributions to the study of morbid
anatomy have thrown light upon the diseases
of every part of the body; but the broad
and philosophical view he has taken of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
processes of pathology has done more than
his most brilliant observations to make the
science of disease.</p>

<p>'In pathology, strictly so called, his two
great achievements&mdash;the detection of the
cellular activity which lies at the bottom of
all morbid as well as normal physiological
processes, and the classification of the important
group of new growths on a natural
histological basis&mdash;have each of them not
only made an epoch in medicine, but have
also been the occasion of fresh extension of
science by other labourers' (Proc. Royal
Soc., 1892).</p>

<p>Virchow has not confined himself to
medicine. He takes the keenest interest in
anthropology and ethnology, on which subjects
he has contributed many papers.
Together with his colleagues Helmholtz the
physicist, and Du Bois Reymond the physiologist,
he has taken a leading place in the
spreading of natural science; but, unfortunately,
he did not take to the doctrine of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Evolution, and for the last thirty years has
been its declared antagonist, rarely missing
an opportunity of denouncing everything but
descriptive anatomy and zoology as the
unsound speculations of dreamers. This has
on more than one occasion brought him into
sharp conflict with Haeckel. His activity is
astonishing, especially if it be remembered that
Virchow has for many years been one of the
most conspicuous leaders of the Progressists
and Radicals in the German Parliament and
Berlin town-council.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Edward Drinker Cope</span> was born at
Philadelphia, Pa. After studying at several
Continental Universities, especially at Heidelberg,
he became first Professor of Natural
Science at Haverford College, and later
Professor of Geology and Mineralogy. He
died at an early age in 1897. As a member
of various geological expeditions and other
surveys, he explored chiefly Kansas, Wyoming,
and Colorado; and he published many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
most suggestive papers on the fossil vertebrate
fauna of North America, and on classification
especially of Amphibia and Reptiles.</p>

<p>Among works of a more general philosophical
scope may be mentioned 'The
Origin of the Fittest,' 1887, and his latest
work, 'The Primary Factors of Organic
Evolution,' 1896.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Albert von <a name="Footnote_50" id="Footnote_50"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50">Koelliker</a></span>
became Professor of Anatomy at Würzburg.
His earlier studies and discoveries contributed
considerably to the systematic development
of the cell theory. In 1844 he observed the
division and further multiplication of the
original egg cell. Next year he showed the
continuity between nerve cells and nerve
fibres in the Vertebrata; later, that the non-striped
or smooth muscular tissue is composed
of cellular elements. He demonstrated that
the Gregarinæ are unicellular creatures. In
1852 he went with his younger friend Gegenbaur
to Messina, where he studied especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the development of the Cephalopoda (cuttlefishes
and allies); and he produced a magnificent
work on Alcyonaria, Medusæ, and
other allied forms. He elucidated the development
of the vertebral column, especially
with reference to the notochord.</p>

<p>In 1848 he founded, together with Th. von
Siebold, the famous <i>Zeitschrift für wissenschaftliche
Zoologie</i>.</p>

<p>A standard work on mammalian embryology
is his 'Entwicklungsgeschichte
des Menschen und der höheren Thiere,' a
text-book of which the second edition
appeared in 1879.</p>

<p>At the anniversary meeting of 1897 he
received the Copley medal, the highest honour
which the Royal Society can bestow.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Carl <a name="Footnote_49" id="Footnote_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49">Gegenbaur</a>
</span> was born on August 21,
1826, in Bavaria. He studied medicine and
kindred subjects in Würzburg, and as a pupil
of Johannes Mueller in Berlin.</p>

<p>In 1852 he went with Koelliker to Messina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
to study the structure and development of the
marine fauna. Important papers on Siphonophora,
Echinoderms, Pteropoda, and, later,
Hydrozoa and Mollusca, were the result.
Soon after his return he was offered the
chair of Anatomy at Jena, and at this retired
spot he produced his most important works,
devoting himself more and more to the study
of the Vertebrata. Since 1875 he has held
the Chair of Anatomy at Heidelberg.</p>

<p>In 1859 he published his 'Principles of
Comparative Anatomy'; but in 1870 he remodelled
it completely, the theory of descent
being the guiding principle. These 'Grundzüge'
were followed by a somewhat more
condensed 'Grundriss,' the second edition of
which was published in 1878, and has been
translated into French and English. In the
meantime he had broken new ground by
the development and treatment of certain
problems concerning the composition and
origin of the limbs, the shoulder-girdle and
the skull, researches which are embodied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
in his 'Untersuchungen zur vergleichenden
Anatomie der Wirbelthiere,' 1864-65-72.</p>

<p>In 1883 he brought out a text-book on
human anatomy. This also marked a new
epoch, because for the first time, not only the
nomenclature, but also the general treatment
of human anatomy, was put upon a firm
comparative anatomical basis. The success
of this work is indicated by the fact that it
reached the sixth edition in 1897.</p>

<p>Lastly, in 1898, appeared the first volume
of what may be called his crowning work,
'Vergleichende Anatomie der Wirbelthiere.'</p>

<p>Gegenbaur is universally recognised, not
only as the greatest living comparative
anatomist, but also as the founder of the
modern side of this science, by having based
it on the theory of descent.</p>

<p>In 1896 he received from the Royal Society
the Copley medal 'for his pre-eminence in
the science of comparative anatomy or animal
morphology.'</p>

<p>His marvellously powerful influence as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
teacher and investigator has made Heidelberg
a centre whence many pupils have
spread his teaching, and above all his method
of research.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Ernst Heinrich Haeckel</span> was born on
February 16, 1834, at Potsdam. He carried
out his academical studies alternately at
Berlin and Würzburg, attracted by such
men as Johannes Mueller, Koelliker, and
Virchow. For years he was undecided what
his career should be, whether that of botanist,
collector, or geographical traveller. Certainly
that of medicine attracted him least, although
in deference to his father's wishes he qualified
and settled down for a year's practice in
Berlin. As he himself has told us, he might
perhaps have proved rather successful as a
physician, to judge from the fact that he did
not lose a single patient. But 'I had only
three patients all told, and the reason of this
is perhaps that I had given on my plate the
hours of consultation as from 5 to 6 <i>a.m.</i>'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>During the year 1859 he travelled as
medical man and artist in Sicily. In 1861
he was induced by Gegenbaur, whose acquaintance
he had made in Würzburg, to
establish himself as a <i>Privat-docent</i> for comparative
anatomy in Jena. And there he
has remained ever since, filling the Chair of
Zoology, and having declined several much
more tempting offers from the Universities of
Würzburg, Vienna, Strassburg, and Bonn.</p>

<p>Within one year, 1865, he wrote the two
volumes of his 'Generelle Morphologie der
Organismen,' as he himself relates, in order
to master his sorrow over the loss of his first
wife. But he broke down, and went to the
Canaries to recruit health and strength. The
'Morphologie,' which has long been out of
print,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> made scarcely any impression. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
was ignored, probably because he had placed
the old-fashioned study of zoology and morphology
upon a thoroughly Darwinistic basis.</p>

<p>On the advice of his friend Gegenbaur, he
gave a more popularly written abstract of
his 'Generelle Morphologie'&mdash;in fact, the
substance of a series of his lectures&mdash;in
the shape of his 'Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschichte.'
This 'History of Natural
Creation,' which in 1898 has reached the
ninth edition (first edition translated into
English in 1873), had the desired effect.
So also had his '<a name="Footnote_42" id="Footnote_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42">Anthropogenie</a> oder
<a name="Footnote_47" id="Footnote_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47">Entwicklungsgeschichte</a> des <a name="Footnote_51" id="Footnote_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51">Menschen</a>,' the
fourth edition of which appeared in 1891.</p>

<p>It was a lucky coincidence that Haeckel
had just finished his preliminary academical
studies, was entirely at leisure, and undetermined
to which branch of natural science
he should devote his genius, when Darwin's
great work was given to the world. Haeckel
embraced the new doctrine fervently, and,
as Huxley was doing in England, he spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
it and fought for it with ever-increasing
vigour in Germany.</p>

<p>With marvellous vigour and quickness of
perception he applied the principles of Evolution
or the theory of descent to the whole
organic world, and not only opened entirely
new vistas for the study of morphology,
but also worked them out and fixed them.
He was the first to draw up pedigrees of
the various larger groups of animals and
plants, filling the gaps by fossils or with
hypothetical forms (the necessary existence
of which he arrived at by logical deductions);
and thus he reconstructed the first universal
pedigree, a gigantic ancestral tree, from the
simple unicellular Am&oelig;ba to Man. Of course
these pedigrees were entirely provisional, as
he himself has over and over again avowed;
but they are, nevertheless, the ideal which all
systematists and morphologists working upon
the basis of Evolution have since been seeking
to establish.</p>

<p>Naturally he was vigorously attacked, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
only by anti-Darwinians, or rather anti-Evolutionists,
but also by many of those
who, having accepted the principle of transformism,
ought to have known better.
Perhaps they thought they did know better.
Imperfections or mistakes in details of the
grand attempt,&mdash;and these, naturally, were
many,&mdash;were singled out as samples of the
whole, which was ridiculed as the romance
of a dreamer.</p>

<p>In the end, however, this hostility, narrow-minded
and unfair in many respects, has done
good to the cause. There has arisen an
ever-increasing school of workers in favour
of the new doctrine. Owing to renewed
research, criticism, corrections in all directions,
we now know considerably more about
natural classification (and this is pedigree)
than when Haeckel first opened out the
whole problem.</p>

<p>Owing to his fearless mode of exposition,
regardless of the indignant wrath which the
new doctrine aroused in certain ecclesiastical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
quarters, Haeckel bore the brunt of almost
endless attacks, and had to write polemical
essays. The result has been that friend and
foe alike are now working on the lines which
he has laid down; most of the ideas which
he was the first to conceive, and to formulate
by inventing a scientific terminology for
them, have become important branches, or
even disciplines, of the science.</p>

<p>Most morphologists of the younger generations
now take these terms for granted, without
remembering the name of their founder.
It is, therefore, perhaps not quite superfluous
to mention some of them:</p>

<p><i>Phylum</i>, or stem, the sum total of all those
organisms which have probably descended
from one common lower form. He distinguished
eight such phyla&mdash;Protozoa,
C&oelig;lenterata, Helminthes or Vermes, Tunicata,
Mollusca, Articulata, and Vertebrata.
The phyla are more or less analogous to
'super-classes,' large branches or 'circles,' or
principal groups of other zoologists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_43" id="Footnote_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43"><i>Phylogeny</i></a>,
the history of the <a name="Footnote_48" id="Footnote_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48">development</a> of the various <a name="Footnote_52" id="Footnote_52"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52">phyla</a>, classes, orders,
families,and species.</p>

<p><i>Ontogeny</i>, the history or study of the
development of the individual, generally
called embryology. In reality the scope of
embryology is the ontogenetic study of the
various species, and this branch of developmental
study alone can be checked by direct,
'exact' observation, for the simple reason
that the individuals alone are entities, while
the species, genera, families, etc., are abstract
ideas.</p>

<p>The <i>ontogenesis of any given living organism
is a short, condensed recapitulation of its
ancestral history or of its phylogenesis</i>. This
is Haeckel's 'fundamental biogenetic law.'</p>

<p>A complete proof of the phylogeny of any
creature would be given by the preservation
of an unbroken series of all its fossil ancestors.
Such a series will in most cases, for obvious
reasons, always remain a desideratum. In a
few cases, however, the desideratum is nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
met: for example, the ancestral line of the
one-toed digitigrade horse from a four-or
five-toed plantigrade and still very generalized
Ungulate is approaching completion.</p>

<p>Phylogenetic study has to rely upon other
help. This is afforded by comparative
anatomy and by the study of ontogeny.
If the latter were a faithful, unbroken recapitulation
of all the stages through which
the ancestors have passed, the whole matter
would be very simple; but we know for
certain that in the individual development
many stages are left out (or, rather, are
hurried through, and are so condensed by
short-cuts being taken that we cannot
observe them), while other features which
have been introduced obscure, and occasionally
modify beyond recognition, the original
course.</p>

<p>Again, the sequence of the appearance
of the various organs is frequently upset
(<i>heterochronism</i>). Some organs are accelerated
in their development, while others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
which we know to be phylogenetically older,
are retarded in making their reappearance in
the embryo.</p>

<p>These disturbing or distorting newly introduced
features or factors show themselves
chiefly in connection with the embryonic conditions
of growth&mdash;for example, yolk-sac,
placenta, amnion. They all come within the
category of <i>cænogenesis</i>: they are cænogenetic,
while the true, undisturbed recapitulation is
<i>palingenetic</i>.</p>

<p>Lastly, some features, so-called rudimentary
or vestigial organs, instead of disappearing,
are most tenacious in their recurrence, while
others of originally fundamental importance
scarcely leave recognisable traces, and are, so
to speak, only hinted at during the embryonic
growth of the creature we happen to study.
Hence arises the philosophical study of
'Dysteleology.'</p>

<p>Among other terms invented by Haeckel,
and now in general use, are <i>Metamere</i>,
<i>Metamerism</i>, <i>C&oelig;lom</i>, <i>Gonochorism</i>, <i>Gastrula</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
<i>Metazoa</i>, <i>Gnathostomata</i>, <i>Acrania</i>, <i>Craniota</i>,
and <i>Amniota</i>.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have dealt with his general
work only, a résumé of which he gave for
many years in a course of thirty lectures
before an audience composed of 'all sorts
and conditions of men.' Students of biology
and of medicine side by side with theologians,
incipient and ordained, jurists, political economists,
and philosophers, crowded his lecture-room
during the 'seventies to hear the master
explaining the 'natural history of creation' or
the mysteries of anthropogenesis. Another
course of eighty lectures during the winter
semester was, and still is, devoted to a
systematic treatment of zoology, while practical
classes are reserved for the more select.</p>

<p>His winning personality and fascinating
eloquence, combined with a clear and concise
delivery, have gained the enthusiastic admiration
of many a student who went to the quiet
University town in order to learn with his
own ears and eyes.</p>

<p>'Natuerliche Schoepfungs-Geschichte.' 2
vols. Berlin, 1st edition, 1868; 9th edition,

Creation' in 1873; the eighth in 1892).</p>

<p>'Monographie der Kalkschwaemme.' 3
vols. Berlin, 1872 (out of print). With the
subtitle, 'An Attempt to solve analytically
the Problem of the Origin of Species.' In
this work, illustrated by sixty plates, he
showed that the Calcispongia are individually
so yielding, so adaptive to external influences,
that it is practically impossible to break up
the whole group into anything like satisfactory
species or genera. According to
predilection, we can distinguish either 1 genus
with only 3 species, or 3, 21, 43 genera, with
21, 111, 181, or 289 species respectively.</p>

<p>In this work, in 1872, Haeckel established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
the homology of the two primary layers, ecto-
and endoderm, throughout the Metazoa.
The attempt to do the same for the four
secondary layers, as made in the second part
of his 'Gastræa-theory,' failed. It caused
an enormous amount of research, hitherto
without a satisfactory solution of the problem.</p>

<p>'Studien zur Gastræa-Theorie.' Jena,
1874. The transformation of the single
primitive egg-cell by cleavage into a globular
mass of cells (Morula)&mdash;which latter, becoming
hollow (and then known as the Blastula),
turns ultimately by invagination or by delamination
into the Gastrula&mdash;is a series of
processes which applies to all Metazoa. The
Gastrula is, therefore, the ancestral form of
the Metazoa; and the Gastræa-theory,
founded by Haeckel, throws light, on the one
hand, upon the mystery of the phyletic connection
of the various animal groups, while,
on the other hand, it connects the Metazoa,
or multicellular organisms, with the lowest
Protozoa. We come to this conclusion because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the Gastrula arises from and passes
through stages which exist as independent,
permanent organisms among the Protozoa.</p>

<p>Needless to say this Gastræa-theory has
been violently attacked in detail, with the
result that various modifications of the Gastrula,
until then undreamed of, have become

world, both living and extinct. Notable in
the work are the many reconstructions of
ancestral forms which, provided Evolution is
true, must have existed&mdash;hypothetical until
they, or something like them, are found in a
fossil state. Everybody who works systematically,
and upon the basis of Evolution,
does, sometimes unconsciously, reconstruct
such links, although he may perhaps not see
the necessity, or have the courage to fix
his vision, by assigning to it all those attributes
or characters which are indicated by
deductions from comparative anatomy, palæontology,
and embryology.</p>

<h2>THEORY OF CELLS.</h2>


<p>The vegetable cell was discovered by
<i>Schleiden</i>, Professor of Botany at Jena, in
1838. Next year <i>Schwann</i> found the animal
cell.</p>

<p>In 1844 <i>Koelliker</i> discovered that the egg
cell, by division and multiplication, becomes
an aggregation&mdash;a heap of new cells.</p>

<p>In 1849 <i>Huxley</i> found the two primary
layers (observed long before by <i>Pander</i> and
<i>Baer</i> in the chick) also in certain Invertebrata,
the Medusæ; and he called these layers
'ectoderm' and 'endoderm' respectively.</p>

<p>In 1851 <i>Remak</i>, in his 'Untersuchungen
über die Entwicklung der Thiere,' showed
the egg to be a simple cell, and that from it,
by repeated division or multiplication, arise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
the germinal layers, and that by differentiation
of the cells of these layers are formed
all the tissues of the body.</p>

<p><i>Kowalevsky</i>, of St. Petersburg, found the
two primary germinal layers also in Worms,
Echinoderms, Articulata, and other animals.</p>

<p><i>Haeckel</i>, in 1872, found the same in the
Sponges. He stated that these two germinal
layers occur in all animals, except in the
Protozoa; and that they are homologous,
or equivalent, in all the groups of animals,
from the Sponges up to Man. In 1873, in
his 'Gastræa-theorie,' he explained the
phylogenetic significance, and tried to show
the homology, of the four secondary germinal
layers.</p>

<h2>FACTORS OF EVOLUTION.</h2>


<p>An organism, as living matter, does not
stand in opposition to, or outside of, the rest
of the world. It is part of the world. It
receives matter from its surroundings, and
gives some back; therefore it is influenced
by its surroundings. It is acted upon, and
it reacts upon the latter, and if these change
(and they are nowhere and never strictly the
same) the organism also <i>varies</i>. It <i>adapts</i>
itself, and if it does not, or, rather, cannot,
do so, it dies, because it is unfit to live in the
world, or, rather, in those particular surroundings
and conditions in which it happens to be.
That organism which yields most easily, accommodates
itself most quickly, has the best
chance of existence&mdash;<i>survival of the fittest</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
'Fitness' in this case does not mean fitness
to live, but rather a particular condition which
happens to fit into the new circumstances.</p>

<p>Adaptation and variation are simultaneous:
they are fundamentally the same. If there
were no adaptability and no variability,
those simplest of organisms which we suppose
to have sprung into existence in the
pre-Cambrian period would long ago have
ceased to exist.</p>

<p>It is the physiological momentum which
models the organism, and, by causing its
adaptations, has produced its organs by
change of function. Gegenbaur illustrates
this most important fundamental truth by
an excellent example. Suppose that, in an
absolutely simple organism, all the parts of
its exterior are under the same functional
conditions, so that each part of the surface
can take in food, and that this is digested,
assimilated, in the interior. There is, in
this condition, not yet any definite organ.
If this organism sinks to the bottom and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
becomes sessile, this part is excluded from
taking in nourishing matter, while the
opposite surface alone remains, or becomes
more, fit for this function. Thus, a simple
variation and adaptation has been produced,
and if the same organism continues in this
position, its bottom cells will estrange themselves
from their original function, while
those on the top will convey the food into
the interior, where a cavity will be formed,
ultimately with a permanent opening, the
primitive gut and mouth, both very different
from the 'foot.'</p>

<p>Thus, by adaptation and variation the
organism acquires new functions, organs,
features, and it gives up and eventually loses
others. Its offspring is like it. Like produces
like. This is the principle of <i>heredity</i>.
Adaptation, when going on generation after
generation on the same lines in the same
direction, becomes continuous, and has an
intensifying, <i>cumulative</i> effect. By always
weeding out from a flock of pigeons those birds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
which possess more dark feathers than the
rest, we ultimately produce an entirely white
race. We hurry on what Nature does slowly.</p>

<p>The inheritance of acquired characters
becomes very obvious in the following
example: The Monera are the lowest living
organisms known; they consist of a mass of
protoplasm, and are still devoid of even a
nucleus. They multiply simply by division;
each half is like the other, and like the parent
(which by this process has ceased to exist),
except that each is smaller and has to grow.
A certain Moneron, <i>Protomyxa aurantiaca</i>,
is orange-coloured, and its offspring is from
the beginning of the same colour, and this
colour has been acquired by that kind of
Monera-like protoplasm which thereby has
become the species called Aurantiaca. We
have no reason for assuming that there
existed from the beginning of life not only
colourless, but also red, orange, and other
kinds of protoplasm. In these simplest of
organisms the whole process of heredity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
seems very obvious; but in the higher ones,
in those which propagate by eggs, the
problem is infinitely more complicated. It
is true that the egg is, strictly, nothing but a
small part of the parental organism, and we
know from everyday experience that this
single egg-cell has in it all the attributes and
characteristics of the parent; but these attributes
and characteristics make their appearance
successively, just as the egg cell of a
chick has neither wings nor feathers, not
even a backbone, but develops these organs
because its parents have them.</p>

<p>The theory that acquired characters are
hereditary has often been vigorously attacked;
but the champions of the negative position
have not given us anything satisfactory
instead. They question, also, the principle
of adaptation as a factor in Evolution, and
substitute 'variation,' coupled with 'natural
selection.'</p>

<p>They point to Darwin's argument: (1) It
is a fact that animals and plants produce a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
much greater number of young than in their
turn grow up to propagate the race; (2) no
two of the frequently many individuals of
the same breed are exactly alike, although
the differences may be hidden to our perception
(this is quite true, because no two
entities can live in absolutely the same place
and conditions); (3) through heredity the
offspring takes over the faculties and features
of the parents; (4) what decides which of
the many individuals (each one possessing
some aberration or variation) are to live and
to propagate the race?&mdash;obviously those
individual variations which happen to make
the lucky possessors most fit for the struggle
for life.</p>

<p>So far, well; but the 'Neo-Darwinians'
imagine that 'adaptation' is not the cause, but
the result, the effect, of the formation of
species. According to them, the species are
neither adapted by, nor do they adapt themselves
to, their surroundings. Adaptation is to
them an accomplished fact, a condition which a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
species happens to be in because its particular
variation is the one which, to the exclusion
of others, suits or fits into its surroundings.
Such a view simply takes variation for
granted, and stipulates it as a something
<i>a priori</i>, without raising the further necessary
question, why there should be any
variations at all. Why, indeed, unless they
are caused by external influences? Haeckel
elucidated this by the conception of adaptation
as explained in the foregoing pages.</p>

<p>These and kindred speculations have produced
some rather curious discussions, which
not infrequently end in conundrums. If we
speak of a case of adaptation as a condition, a
fact, we easily run the risk of getting into confusion
about cause and effect. For example: Is
the stag swift because he has long and slender
legs, or are his legs long because he is swift?
In reality, swiftness and length of legs are
cause and effect in one. His legs have been
so modified as to make him swift, because he
has put them continuously to whatever was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
his full speed, which in his thick-footed
ancestors was probably a very slow one.
The above question reads, therefore, more
sensibly as follows: Has the stag become
swift because his legs have become long and
slender, or have his legs become long and
slender because he has attained swiftness?
Now, we see that both halves of the double
question are practically the same and instantly
suggest the answer.</p>

<p>A fundamental difference between artificial
machines and living organisms is that the
former are worn out by use, while the latter
not only repair the loss caused by use, but are
also stimulated to further increase. On the
other hand, organs which are not put into
function, or are not used, <i>degenerate</i>. The
various cells of the organ react upon external
stimuli by increased activity. Why this should
be so is another question&mdash;perhaps because
those which do not would soon be not fit to
survive. Each cell has a function; the more
specialized the more intense it is. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
external stimulus, every contact with the
outer surroundings, is an insult, necessarily
of detrimental effect, as it disturbs the equilibrium
of the cell body. It must, therefore,
be of advantage to the cells' well-being to
return as soon as possible to the <i>status quo
ante</i>, and this can only be done by increased
activity.</p>

<p>In the present state of our knowledge,
we can approach only the simplest cases of
acquisition of characteristics. Mostly they
are so complicated, subject to so many unthought-of
conditions, that we do not know
from which end to approach the problem.
Frequently the supposed use of certain
obvious features is the merest guesswork.
This applies especially to features to which
we are not accustomed (although wrongly
so) to assign a function&mdash;for example, coloration.
A green tree-frog will with predilection
rest on green leaves. The advantages
of concealment are obvious, and in this case
he 'adapts himself' to the surroundings by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
making for green localities: if he did not
he would be eaten up sooner than his more
circumspect comrades. But this making for,
and sitting in, the green has not <i>necessarily</i>
made him of that colour. Extreme advocates
of one view would argue as follows:
Once upon a time there were among the
offspring of ancestral tree-frogs some which,
among other colours, exhibited green, not
much, perhaps not even perceptible to our
eyes. The occurrence of this colour, according
to them, was spontaneous, a freak&mdash;as if
in reality there were anything spontaneous
in the sense of being causeless. The
descendants of these more greenish creatures,
provided they did not pair with frogs of the
ordinary set, became still greener (by accumulative
inheritance), and so on, until the green
was pronounced sufficient to be of advantage
when competition could set in.</p>

<p>With this view there is always the difficulty
of understanding how the initial very
small changes can be useful, unless we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
to deal with extremely simple organisms. Is
it likely in the case of our frogs that an
almost imperceptible variation in colour makes
them more fit to live? We have to assume
that 'luck' or chance kept them for generations
out of harm's reach, until the accumulation
of green, hitherto quite ineffective,
neither harmful nor useful, became strong
enough to be effective. Such cases undoubtedly
happen.</p>

<p>But we can also argue out this problem
in a somewhat different way, which goes
nearer to the root of the whole process. The
original slight, imperceptible change in pigmentation
is not a spontaneous freak; it was
caused by the direct influence of the surroundings
in which the particular frogs
happened to live, be this factor light or
temperature or food. Thus it stands to
reason that the offspring, living under similar
conditions, will be acted upon in the same
way. That factor which has added green to
the parents will add green to the children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
until by accumulative inheritance a more
decidedly green race is produced.</p>

<p>The offspring of green plants do not
become green when grown in the dark; the
young plants inherit not the green, but the
capacity of becoming green when acted upon
by sunlight. This as an instance of direct
influence of the surroundings on a substance
(chlorophyll), which has not yet performed a
function. But the kittens of a pair of black
cats produce black hair before they are born,
and we have no reason to doubt that the
black pigment in their tegumentary structures
is ultimately referable to the action of the
sunlight. In many instances creatures living
for generations in darkness become white,
pigmentless, and they regain it when exposed
to light. For example, the white, colourless
Proteus from the caves of Adelsberg becomes
clouded grey, and ultimately jet black, when
kept in a tank whence light is not strictly
excluded.</p>

<p>Blindness is a very general characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
of creatures which dwell in darkness. There
are all stages between total blindness and
weak eyes. Now, do these blind creatures
live in darkness because they are blind, or
have they become first weak-eyed and then
blind because of the continuous disuse of
their eyes? The former explanation has
actually been suggested! Individuals not
smitten, but spontaneously, as a freak, born
with sore eyes, have crept into the darkness
for relief and have produced a blind race!
To carry such a notion to the bitter end leads
to absurdities. Anyhow, it is not understandable
where the benefit of losing the
eyesight arises. It can be explained only
by continued disuse: witness <i>Spalax typhlus</i>,
the blind mole, and, above all, the Endoparasites.</p>

<p>Let us now take an example to explain the
influence of a tangible external stimulus.
Repeated pressure produces callosities.
Although they are not exactly beneficial
in the shape of corns on our toes, they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
so on our hands. At any rate, the morphologist
can trace the development of the
footpads, nails, hoofs, and horns, step by
step from small beginnings. The cells of
the Malpighian stratum, of the inner, active
portion of our epidermis, are excited to extra
activity, and by continually producing more
horn cells than peel off the surface of the
skin in the normal process of wear and tear
cause the formation of the pad. It need
scarcely be mentioned that hypertrophic
growths are not necessarily useful; they are
often harmful, and in that case pathological.</p>

<p>Lastly, a few words about the very difficult
question of <i>teleology</i>. In trying to explain
Evolution in a mechanical&mdash;sometimes called
monistic, but in reality natural&mdash;way, we
exclude anything like a set purpose, a goal,
or ideal, a final condition which the organism
strives to attain. Unknown, however, to
many morphologists, especially embryologists,
their writings are full of this teleological
notion. Indeed, there are many cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
in which an organism becomes changed, and
quickly, too, in a way which cannot but be
called reasonable. It starts modifications, be
they outgrowths, alterations in shape or colour,
or the making good of injuries received,
which by 'short-cuts' produce the only
advantageous result that can reasonably
satisfy the new requirement or altered circumstances.</p>

<p>Trees growing in precarious positions,
after part of the supporting rock has slipped
away, throw out new roots, and rearrange some
of the old ones in the only way which could
save the tree. In animals which have lost part
of a limb the wound closes up, and what is left
is turned into a serviceable stump&mdash;for
example, in water-tortoises (creatures in which
reproduction of lost limbs does not happen).
In frogs and newts the lost part is reproduced,
not correctly, but in a good semblance.
Tortoises which have had their shell smashed
can throw off an astonishingly large portion
and renew the bone as well as the over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>lapping
scutes; but this mending is not neatly
done. It serves the requirement, but it is
patchwork; the new shell is such as no
tortoise ever possessed before.</p>

<p>Mammals transported into colder countries,
or subjected to continued exposure, grow a
thicker coat; and the same kind of tree
which in a sheltered valley is tall, large-leaved,
and soft-wooded, assumes a very
different aspect, although perhaps growing
into a healthy specimen, when planted on a
wind-exposed hill.</p>

<p>There is no room, or, rather, no time, to
apply to these cases the principle of many
variations or the long-continued accumulation
of infinitely small changes. The thing is to
be done quickly, or not at all. Nor can we
explain the mending of a wound, which
implies an activity of countless cells, simply
as a case of, or similar to, the reproduction
of a lost part; against such an
explanation militates the almost absolute
unlikelihood of that precise injury having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
happened before to any of the creature's
ancestors.</p>

<p>Still, I think we are brought near the solution
of the mystery by such considerations.
We see no difficulty in the regeneration of a
few cells, or in the making good of the disturbance
suffered by one of the most simple
organisms; but we become suspicious when
we see that countless cells, not of one kind,
but of the most varied tissues and parts of
the body, make common cause in remedying
a defect in a serviceable way.</p>

<p>We must assume that since the beginning
of life organisms have been subjected to
countless insults. We can scarcely speak of
a wound in an Amæba; but these insults
have always been made good, and whenever
this was not the case, that particular organism
came to an end. As these organisms developed
into more complicated ones, the
possible insults became more serious, more
complicated; and the organisms took adaptive
measures so as to be superior to them. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
action, I have no hesitation in declaring,
became by heredity a habit. The whole
creature became so thoroughly 'imbued' (for
want of a better word) with the finding of
ways and means for meeting sudden, serious
conditions, that it now acts directly, and
produces by a short-cut, with the least amount
of time and with the smallest possible waste
of material, that which meets the occasion,
thereby saving the life of the individual and
that of the race. This we cannot but call
reasonable and to the purpose, although it is
all carried out by <i>causæ efficientes</i> without
there being any <i>causæ finales</i>.</p>

<h2>GEOLOGICAL TIME AND EVOLUTION.</h2>


<p>One million years is a stretch of time beyond
our conception. We can arrive at a more or
less adequate understanding of what a million
individuals or concrete things means. Several
Continental nations can put more than a
million men into the field. We can gaze at
a building which contains as many bricks;
and we know that our own body is composed
of millions of millions of cells. No
such help applies to time, because that itself
is an entirely relative, abstract conception.
We can imagine what one hundred years are
like&mdash;a span of time seemingly short to the
hale and hearty octogenarian, enormous to
the child, totally inapplicable to certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
animals whose whole life is crowded into one
single day.</p>

<p>Astronomers have long ceased to reckon
distances by miles or any other understandable
unit. They express the distances
between us and the stars and nebulæ by
'years of light.' Try to imagine a unit of
length equal to that which is passed through
by light (186,000 miles per second) in one
year. Not so very long ago the enormous
distances resulting from astronomical calculations
were looked upon as the most serious
objection to the correctness of the astronomers'
views as to the distances which separate our
globe from the nearest fixed stars. We have
not yet accustomed ourselves to reckoning
time by some similar broadly-conceived
standard&mdash;say æons of so many thousand
years each.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we possess no data whatever
for calculating the age of the successive
geological strata. Thanks to Lyell, the
theory of violent universal cataclysms has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
been done away with. It is more probable
that the same agencies have acted which are
now changing the aspect of the globe; and
these changes are slow, as far as we know
them&mdash;at least, as far as the formation of
sedimentary strata is concerned, and these
alone we have to deal with. Various calculations
have been made, based upon the
denudation of the mountains, the filling up of
the valleys by the débris, the formation of
deltas, etc. The results give enormous
stretches of time, but all of them unsatisfactory,
because the methods are so very local in
their application.</p>

<p>The least objectionable attempt is that
which, based upon astronomical calculations,
tried to fix the height of the last Glacial
epoch<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> at about 200,000 years ago, and
asserted that since its beginning in the
Pliocene epoch as many as 270,000 years
have elapsed. The duration of the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
Tertiary period has by the same authorities
been fixed approximately at 3,000,000 to
4,000,000 years. Beyond this we cannot venture
without the wildest speculation; but we
know to a certain extent the thickness of the
various sedimentary strata, which amount in
all to from 100,000 to 175,000 feet&mdash;on the
average perhaps 130,000 feet, or about twenty
miles.</p>

<p>Unless we prefer giving up all attempt
at calculation as absolutely hopeless, and
thus resign the whole problem, we must at
least try to arrive at some results, and then
see if these cannot reasonably be made use of.</p>

<p>Neither geologist nor physicist, and no
zoologist, would accept the suggestion that
these 130,000 feet of stratified rocks have
been deposited within only as many years,
although the average rate of deposit would
in that case be not more than 1 foot per
year. On the other hand, an indignant protest
is raised against the assumption of
1,000,000,000 years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Kelvin<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> has come to the conclusion
(from data which various other authorities
regard as very unsatisfactory) that not
much more than 100,000,000 years can have
elapsed since the molten globe acquired a
consolidated crust. Further time must have
passed before the surface had become stable
and cool enough to allow the temperature of
the collecting oceans to fall below boiling-point,
and it is obvious that life cannot
possibly have begun until after this had
happened.</p>

<p>Wallace, in his 'Island Life,' by making
use of Professor A. Geikie's results as to the
rate of denudation of matter by rivers from
the area of their basins, and estimating the
average rate of deposition, concludes that
'the time required to produce this thickness
of rock [Professor Haughton's maximum of
177,000 feet] at the present rate of denudation
and deposition is only 28,000,000 years.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Our lower assumption of 130,000 feet thickness
would give only 20,000,000 years&mdash;a
rate of 1 foot in 154 years.</p>

<p>Again, if we prefer round numbers to start
with, we have only to assume that the age of
the whole Tertiary period, with its 3,000 feet
thickness, is 3,000,000 years (<i>i.e.</i>, 1,000 feet
in 1,000,000 years, or 1 foot in 1,000 years,
surely an excessively slow rate); then
130,000,000 years would bring us to the
bottom of the Laurentian or pre-Cambrian
deposits. Of course, it is a pure assumption
that the same rate of destruction and sedimentation
applies to the whole of the strata;
but we know nothing to the contrary, especially
if we consider the average periods, the
quick periods of extra activity, taken with the
slow periods or those of standstill.</p>

<p>Dana estimated the length of the whole
Tertiary period at one-fifteenth of the Mesozoic
and Palæozoic combined. If we take
the duration of the Tertiary period, as before,
as 3,000,000 to 4,000,000 years, the total<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
will amount to from 45,000,000 to 60,000,000
years.</p>

<p>Lastly, Walcott<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> has estimated the duration
of the Palæozoic, Mesozoic, and Cænozoic
or Tertiary epochs at about 17,000,000,
7,000,000 and 3,000,000 years respectively,
giving 27,700,000 years from the beginning
of the Cambrian; and Williams<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> has calculated
the relative duration of the smaller
epochs. See the table on p. 149.</p>

<p>The results of all these calculations fall
surprisingly well within the limits of Lord
Kelvin's allowance. Of course they are
based upon assumptions, but none of them
is inherently unreasonable; and it was my
purpose to draw attention to the surprising
coincidence in the closeness of these results,
perhaps too good to be true. Such calculations
are considered close enough if they
range within a few multiples of each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>
<p>Zoologists have fallen into the habit of
requiring enormous lengths of time for the
evolution of the animal kingdom. We know
that Evolution is at best a slow process, and
the conception of the changes necessary to
evolve man from monkey-like creatures, these
from the lowest imaginary mammals, these
from some reptilian stock, thence descending
to Dipnoan fish-like creatures, and so on
back into Invertebrata, down to the simple
Monera&mdash;this conception is indeed gigantic.
Innumerable, almost endless, slow changes
require seemingly unlimited time, and as time
is endless, why not draw upon it <i>ad libitum</i>?</p>

<p>Huxley pointed out that it took nearly the
whole of the Tertiary epoch to produce the
horse out of the four-toed Eohippos, and
that, if we apply this rate to the rest of
its pedigree, enormous times would be required.
This is, however, a very misleading
statement, which necessitates considerable
reduction, in conformity with our increased
palæontological knowledge. Animals of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
genus Equus&mdash;namely, Ungulata, with one
toe, and with a certain tooth pattern&mdash;from
the Upper Miocene of India are now known.
Moreover, it is not simply a question of the
gradual loss of the side-toes. The change
from the fox-sized little Eohippos and Hyracotherium,
so far as skull, teeth, vertebral
column, and limbs are concerned (about the
soft parts we know next to nothing), is a
very great one indeed.</p>

<p>Elephants and mammoths seem to have
developed very rapidly. None are known
from Eocene strata; but towards the end
of the Miocene they had spread over Asia,
Europe, and North America, and that in
great numbers. The Eocene Amblypoda
are still so different that we hesitate to connect
them ancestrally with the elephants.</p>

<p>The Pinnipedia (seals and walruses) are
strongly modified fissiped Carnivora, and have
existed since at least the Upper Miocene;
the transformation must have been accomplished
within the Miocene period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that
various groups have from the time of their
first appearance burst out into an exuberant
growth of modifications in form, size, and
numbers, into all possible&mdash;and one might
almost say impossible&mdash;shapes; and they
have done this within comparatively short
periods, after which they have died out not
less rapidly. It seems almost as if these go-ahead
creatures had, by accepting every
possible modification and carrying the same
to the extreme, too quickly exhausted their
plasticity&mdash;which, after all, must have limits&mdash;thereby
becoming unable to meet successfully
the requirements of further changes in their
surroundings. The slowly developing groups,
keeping within main lines of Evolution, and
not being tempted into aberrant side-issues,
had, after all, a much better chance of onward
evolution.</p>

<p>A good example of the former are the
Dinosaurs. We do not know their ancestors;
but we have here to deal only with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
range of transformation. The oldest known
forms occur in the Upper Trias; they attain
their most stupendous development in the
Upper Jurassic and in the Wealden; and
they have died out with the Cretaceous epoch.
But already some of their earliest forms had
assumed bipedal gait, and the Oolitic Compsognathus
had developed almost bird-like hind-limbs.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are many
instances of extremely slow development&mdash;facts
which raise the difficult question of
'persistent types.' Are these due to a state of
perfection which cannot be improved upon?
Or are they due to a kind of morphological
consolidation (not necessarily specialization)
which can no longer yield easily, so that therefore
through changes in their surroundings
they may come to an end sooner than more
plastic groups?</p>

<p>Struthio, the ostrich; Orycteropus, the
Cape ant-eater; Tapirus, and many others,
existed in the Miocene age practically as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
they are now; but pre-Pliocene dolphins,
cats, monkeys, stags, all belong to closely-allied
and well-defined 'genera,' but different
from the living forms.</p>

<p>Alligators and crocodiles are known from
the Upper Chalk; Tomistoma since the
Miocene; Gavialis since the Pliocene.</p>

<p>The oldest surviving reptile is Sphenodon,
the Hatteria of New Zealand, a fair representative
of what generalized reptiles of the
later Triassic period seem to have been like;
and to the same period belongs Ceratodus,
the Australian mud-fish, hitherto the oldest
known surviving genus of a very ancient and
low type so far as Vertebrata are concerned.</p>

<p>Now let us see if the above estimates of
geological time are so utterly inapplicable to
animal evolution. On purpose we take one
of the lowest estimates, about 28,000,000
years, and apportion them equally to the
various strata or epochs.</p>

<p>The original owner of the famous Trinil
skull, a <i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i>, lived,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
according to some, in the Late Pliocene,
according to others in the Early Plistocene,
period&mdash;that is to say, somewhere about
the beginning of our last Glacial epoch,
some 270,000 years ago. Assuming that
he and his like reached puberty at sixteen
to twenty years of age, about 17,000 generations
would lie between him and ourselves,
or, to put it more forcibly, between
him and the lowest living human races&mdash;say
the Ceylonese Veddahs. Only 250 generations,
at twenty years, carry us back to
3000 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> (<i>i.e.</i>, beyond the ken of history); and
if it be objected that the differences between
the oldest inhabitants of Egypt, the Naquada,
and the present Fellahin are very slight,
we are welcome to multiply these differences
sixty or seventy fold, in order to arrive at the
Pithecanthropus level. But these Naquada
had no metal implements, and there cannot be
the slightest doubt that the development of
the human race went on by leaps and bounds
after certain discoveries had been made&mdash;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
wit, the use of implements and that of fire.
That creature which first took up a stone or
a branch and wielded it thereby got such an
enormous advantage over his fellow-creatures
that his mental and bodily development went
on apace. The same applies to the improvement
of speech. We assume the single,
monophyletic origin of mankind at one place,
in one district; and the differences between
some of the races of man are great enough
to constitute what we might call species.
Compare the Venus of Milo, that noble expression
of the ancient Greeks' notion of
female beauty, with the 'products of art' of
the Veddahs or the dwarfs of Central Africa,
or think of the beau-idéal which a Michael
Angelo could possibly have evolved if he had
never seen any but such people.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;"&nbsp; &nbsp;II. contains the percentage of the duration of the

smaller epochs, as computed from Walcott and
Williams' statements.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;" &nbsp; &nbsp;V. Representatives of stages of the ancestral line of
man. The names stand in the level of the
stratum in which they have made their first
appearance.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;" &nbsp; &nbsp;VI. contains the number of years which, in the present
calculation, have been assumed necessary for
the animal to reach puberty.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;"&nbsp; &nbsp;VII. contains the number of generations which can
have elapsed from stage to stage. For example,
60,000 generations separate the earliest known
anthropoid apes from Pithecanthropus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let us follow the descent of man further
back. The next stage, reckoning backwards,
is that from Pithecanthropus to <i>bonâ-fide</i>
anthropoid apes. They are represented in
the Miocene by various genera&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, Pliopithecus
and Dryopithecus. According to
Croll and Wallace, 850,000 years ago carry us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
into the Miocene epoch. Assuming that
these apes lived about 600,000 years before
Pithecanthropus, namely, in the later half of
the Miocene, and taking puberty at ten years
of age, a high estimate, we get not less than
60,000 generations.</p>

<p>2. From Apes back to lowest Lemurs in
the lowest Eocene. The date of Eocene
being fixed at 3,000,000, we have about
2,100,000 years for this stage; assuming as
much as five years for puberty, this results in
420,000 generations.</p>

<p>3. From Lemures to Prototheria. The
earliest known mammalian remains come
from the Rhætic, or top formation of the
Triassic epoch; allowing for the Rhætic
only 100,000 years, we have to add the
whole of the Jurassic and Cretaceous, in all
about 5,500,000 years. Assuming three
years for a generation, we get 1,800,000
generations.</p>

<p>4. From Prototheria to something like the
Theromorpha at the bottom of the Triassic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
strata. A duration of 1,700,000 years divided
by four gives 425,000 generations.</p>

<p>5. From Theromorpha to Proreptilia,
represented by Eryops and Cricotus from
the Lower Permian of Texas. Allowing
1,000,000 years, each generation at four
years, we obtain 250,000 generations.</p>

<p>6. From Proreptilia to Eotetrapoda, the
first terrestrial Vertebrata, represented by
something like the Stegocephali, the earliest
of which are known from the Coal-measures.
Assuming them to have come into existence
at the bottom of the Coal-measures, for the
duration of which we may guess 2,000,000
years, we get, with four years' allowance for
puberty, 500,000 generations.</p>

<p>7. From Eotetrapoda to a not yet separated
or differentiated group of Crossopterygian
and Dipnoan fishes, both of which
are known from Devonian strata. The
duration of the latter has been computed at
4,000,000 years, which, with 1,000,000 for
the Mountain Limestone formation, gives us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
5,000,000 for this stage. Assuming, for the
sake of round numbers, as much as five
years for a generation, we get 1,000,000
generations.</p>

<p>8. Earliest stage, down to the first fish-like
creatures. Teeth and spines indicating the
existence of fishes are known from the Upper
Silurian. By carrying the earliest fishes down
to the bottom of the Silurian, with 2,700,000
years' duration, and allowing three years for
attaining puberty, the calculation results in
900,000 generations.</p>

<p>Further back we cannot go. We do not
know of any Vertebrate remains from the
Ordovician and Cambrian, which together
represent 6,700,000 years, enough for at least
half as many generations of Prochordate
creatures. The pre-Cambrian or Laurentian
epoch lies quite beyond the reach of calculation,
nor have we any trustworthy fossil
remains of living matter from these strata, to
which, however, Haeckel and others refer the
first beginnings of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>All the above calculations are, of course,
only approximate. What we do know is
the existence of representatives of the stages,
our proofs being the fossils; but when we refer
the origin of the Eotetrapoda, for example, to
the bottom and not somewhere to the middle
of the Coal-measures, we are guessing
merely. Alterations in the levels assumed
for the various stage-representatives will, of
course, alter the result of the number of
generations; but the leading idea, as a
whole, is not thereby upset. The fact
remains that in the Upper Silurian we have
fishes; from the Coal-measures onwards, fishes
and Amphibia; since the Permian, fishes,
Amphibia, and reptiles; since the end of the
Trias these three classes and the Mammalia;
and lastly, at least since the Plistocene, man
himself. If Evolution is true at all, the
transformation from early fish-like creatures
to man has come about within these epochs.
Being able to assign a time of duration to
each of them, with an approximate total of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
21,000,000 years, we are also able to put
the whole ancestral series to a test by expressing
each great stage in generations. The
result is very satisfactory. The whole enormous
stretch from the lowest fish-like creatures
to man has been resolved into more
than 5,000,000 successive generations, and
each of these means a little step forwards in
onward Evolution.</p>

<p>Nothing is to be gained for the understanding
of our problem of Evolution if we
multiply this enormous number of generations
by ten or any other multiple. We
are not able to conceive changes so small
as those which necessarily have existed
between Pithecanthropus and man if the
whole striking difference is analysed into
17,000 steps. Every one of these stages in
the modifications of the muscles, the skeletal
framework, increase of brain, shortening of
the trunk, lengthening of the legs, improvement
of the hands, loss of the hairy coat, etc.,
is truly microscopical, imperceptible, just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
the Evolutionist imagines the whole process
to have been. Again, where is the difficulty
implied by the change from an air-breathing,
in many structural points half-amphibian, fish
into a primitive land-crawling four-footed
creature, if we are allowed to resolve the
transformation into 1,000,000 stages? So far
from there being any difficulty, rather does it
appear questionable if so many infinitely small
changes have been necessary to bring about
this result.</p>

<p>One thousand years make apparently no
difference in the evolution of animals, nor
does one second change the aspect of the
hands on the face of a clock, nor did Julius

<p class="center"><big>MONISM</big>;<br />
<small>OR</small>,<br />
The Confession of Faith of a Man of Science.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Crown 8vo., cloth. Price 1s. 6d. net.</i>
</p>

<p>'We may readily admit that Professor Haeckel has stated his case
with the clearness and courage which we should expect of him, and
that his lecture may be regarded as a fair and authoritative statement
of the views now held by a large number of scientifically educated
people.'&mdash;<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>'The Monism, which is the substance of his faith, is thus defined by
him: "Our conviction that there lives one spirit in all things, and that
the whole cognizable world is constituted, and has been developed, in
accordance with one common fundamental law." As the confession of
a distinguished man of science, this little work deserves to be read.'&mdash;<i>North
British Daily Mail.</i></p>

<p>'This "Confession of Faith" was delivered by the great German
scientist, its author, as an extemporaneous address at Altenburg rather
more than two years ago. There are, no doubt, a large number of
English readers who will welcome a translation, for this "connecting of
religion and science" has long troubled many earnest students of
modern science.'&mdash;<i>Publisher's Circular.</i></p>

<p>'This is a little book of great daring, an example of the wild speculative
flights of one of the very ablest and greatest of our contemporary
men of science.'&mdash;<i>Aberdeen Free Press.</i></p>

<p>'The address, whatever we may think of its conclusions, is, however,
most interesting reading, and is admirably done into English by the
translator.'&mdash;<i>Literary World.</i></p>

</p>

<p>'Dr. Adolf Harnack is at the present time undoubtedly the leading liberal
authority in Germany on matters connected with early Christian history.'&mdash;<i>The
Times.</i></p>

<p>'Those who are interested in early Church history know how to prize anything
from the pen of Prof. Harnack. They will not be disappointed with the present
paper, in which, with his accustomed learning and acute criticism, he annotates
and comments upon the fragments of primitive church law which partly form the
basis of the Apostolic Canons.'&mdash;<i>British Weekly.</i></p>

<p>'The wide circulation of this volume would be of the happiest augury for a
more scientific and worthy conception of the organization of the primitive
Church.'&mdash;Dr. <span class="smcap">Marcus Dods</span> in <i>The Bookman</i>.</p>

<p class="center">  By J. WELLHAUSEN,<br />
<small>PROFESSOR AT MARBURG.</small>
</p>

<p>'This work is now issued for the third time as an independent
treatise. It admirably epitomizes the subject, and exhibits on almost
every page evidences of Professor Wellhausen's profound study.'&mdash;<i>Publishers'
Circular.</i></p>

<p>'We would only say that those who differ from his critical views
will yet do well to study them, and to read this history in which
he applies them. Its separate publication, in a handy form and at
a moderate price, makes it generally accessible.'&mdash;<i>North British
Daily Mail.</i></p>

<p>'The publication in a separate form of Professor Wellhausen's
article in the "Encyclopædia Britannica" on "Israel" will be very
warmly welcomed by many readers.'&mdash;<i>Manchester Guardian.</i></p>

<p>'We are very glad to welcome an edition of Professor Wellhausen's
"Sketch of the History of Israel and Judah" in a convenient
and handy form. This is the first time it has appeared in
a separate form. It is already known to students; it ought now
to become popular. It is based on the learned author's studies in
Hebrew literature and history, and, though not controversial in form,
it differs totally from orthodox presentations of the subject.'&mdash;<i>Westminster
Review.</i></p>

<p>'A sketch which has created such widespread and profound
interest as this could not be kept in the pages of a voluminous
encyclopædia. Wellhausen's words necessarily have exceptional
importance, even in the esteem of those who differ from him <i>toto
c&oelig;lo</i>.'&mdash;<i>Baptist Magazine.</i></p>

<p>'The profound scholarship of the author does not elevate his
writing above the interest of the general reader, and a vivid idea
of the involved Jewish history is obtainable from this volume.'&mdash;<i>Christian

<p class="center"><small>STRICKLAND CURATOR AND LECTURER ON ZOOLOGY TO THE UNIVERSITY,
  CAMBRIDGE.</small>
</p>

<p>'At the end of his work Dr. Gadow adds a useful chapter on the geographical
distribution of the Vertebrata, with a table showing the approximate number of
the known recent species. He also gives a fanciful though striking calculation
to show how some groups are still in the ascendant, while others are distinctly
declining. The little volume is indeed a welcome addition to the biological
student's library, and it deserves the wide circulation which its author's eminence
is likely to ensure for it.'&mdash;<i>Natural Science.</i></p>

<p>'It is a book, it need hardly be said, for the student; it is simply a list of the
principal sub-divisions of backboned animals, with just as much definition as is
needed. It may be regarded as an exceedingly concentrated extract of a full
text-book of the vertebrates.'&mdash;<i>Daily Chronicle.</i></p>

<p class="center">  <i>Containing Map and 89 Illustrations.</i>
</p>

<p>'Some years back "Wild Spain," one of the best books of its kind, made you
desirous of knowing more of the country. And Hans Gadow has deepened this
feeling in his excellent volume "In Northern Spain," and that to an enormous
extent. Dwelling at inn or farm, or in their own tent, they saw the country as
it has been seen but rarely, and they came to know the inhabitants as they can
be known in no other fashion.'&mdash;<i>Black and White.</i></p>

<p>'To persons visiting the provinces with which the author deals, this book will
be invaluable, and will do more to point their attention to objects of interest than
existing guide-books of Spain, most of which are out of date.'&mdash;<i>The Field.</i></p>

years.'&mdash;<i>Literary World.</i></p>

seem a <i>petitio principii</i>. Leaving aside the consideration
that no living creature is absolutely perfect, in the sense that
its organization cannot become more efficient or proficient,
we have here to deal with relative perfection of the whole
organization. A fish or a snake is in its way more specialized
than a mammal; but specialization does not necessarily
mean height of development: it generally means life in a
comparatively narrow groove. The acts of giving birth and
nourishing the young with the mother's milk is a much
higher stage than the act of laying eggs and letting them
run their chance. The development of a hairy coat goes
along with heightened temperature of the blood, subsequent
greater independence of the surrounding temperature, and
increased steady activity of the brain and other nerve-centres.
The brain of the Mammalia, in its minute structure,
is much more complex. This rule applies to some of
the principal sense organs, chiefly the nose and the ear.
The skeleton, not so much as a whole as in the various bones
and joints, is more neatly finished, and built up more in
conformity with 'scientific principles,' than is the case even
with birds, in spite of their marvellous specialization. The
same is the case with the vascular system, notably the heart
and the veins, and with the excretory organs. In all of these
many imperfections, still to be found in the other classes,
have been corrected in Mammalia. The Primates take an
easy first by their hands, and among them the apes and man
himself by their brains.</p>

Hence it is misleading to divide the Tetrapoda into the two
main groups of Amphi-and Mono-condylia, and therefrom
to conclude that the two-condyled Mammalia are more
closely related to the likewise amphicondylous Amphibia
than to the so-called monocondylous Reptiles.</p>
